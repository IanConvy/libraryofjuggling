	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Four Ball Windmill is a 
	four ball variation of the normally three ball Windmill. However, unlike its 
	smaller counterpart, the balls in the Four Ball Windmill never actually 
	switch hands, so the pattern can in fact be seen as an incredibly distorted 
	Fountain. Due to the crossed-arm nature of the trick, the Four Ball Fountain 
	can also be thought of as a variation of the Four Ball Mills Mess, however 
	learning that pattern beforehand is not necessary, though it certainly will 
	help.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Four Ball Windmill, start with two balls in each 
	hand. Then, make a fairly high throw from your dominant hand toward the 
	center of your body. Quickly follow that up with an under-the-arm throw from 
	your non-dominant hand in the same direction. At this point the first ball 
	should be coming back down, so you are going to make another throw toward 
	the center of your body from the same position as the first throw, clearing 
	space for you to catch the first ball. You are then going to make a second 
	under-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand and catch the second ball. 
	Then catch the third and fourth balls with your dominant and non-dominant 
	hands respectively.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballwindmillfour.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until you are able to perform all four throws 
	and catches smoothly and consistently. Then, all that&#39;s left to run the full 
	Four Ball Windmill is to make another throw from your dominant hand before 
	catching the third ball, along with another under-the-arm throw from your 
	non-dominant hand before catching the fourth ball. Just repeat this cycle of 
	alternating throws and you will be juggling the Four ball Windmill.</p>
