	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reverse Fountain is 
	essentially just the regular Fountain pattern with reverse Two-in-one 
	throws, such that the balls travel from the outside of your body to the 
	center. Since balls from each side are thrown toward each other in this 
	pattern, it is slightly more difficult to learn than the standard Fountain.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before trying the Reverse Fountain, it is important that you 
	are able to do a reverse Two-in-one with each hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/reversefountaintwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin practicing the full pattern, start&nbsp; with two 
	balls in each hand. Throw one ball from your dominant hand as if in a 
	reverse Two-in-one, and then throw a ball from your non-dominant hand in the 
	same fashion. As the first ball reaches its peak, throw another ball from 
	your dominant hand, and then do the same for your non-dominant hand. Then 
	catch the balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/reversefountainrun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until you can make all four throws accurately. 
	Then it&#39;s just a matter of adding in throws and soon you will be juggling 
	the Reverse Fountain. </p>
