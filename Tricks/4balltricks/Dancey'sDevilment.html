	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dancey&#39;s Devilment is a four 
	ball pattern &quot;established&quot; by Charlie Dancey. The trick was first mentioned in

	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Encyclopædia_of_Ball_Juggling">The 
	Encyclopædia of Ball Juggling</a>, in which it was vaguely described as &quot;a 
	four- or a five-ball pattern with the looping features of Rubenstein&#39;s 
	Revenge combined with Multiplex throws of varying kinds.&quot; The exact details 
	of the trick weren&#39;t given, and Dancey later stated that he had no idea what 
	the pattern really looked like. Other jugglers began trying to recreate the 
	trick, and soon there were several variations of &quot;Dancey&#39;s Devilment&quot; 
	floating about. For this tutorial I have chosen the only variation where I 
	could find video documentation.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Dancey&#39;s Devilment, start with two balls in 
	your non-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant. Cross your 
	non-dominant hand underneath your dominant hand, and then make a stacked 
	under-the-arm multiplex. The top ball should be thrown roughly twice as high 
	as the bottom ball, relative to the palm of your hand. As that bottom ball 
	reaches its peak, you are going to swing your dominant hand around and claw 
	catch it, uncrossing your arms as you do so. As the top multiplexed ball 
	descends, you are going to make a roughly vertical throw from the center of 
	your body (ideally it should be angled slightly toward your dominant side). 
	You will then catch the top multiplexed ball in your dominant hand and catch 
	the other ball with your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/danceysdevilmentthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the fourth 
	ball, you are going to start with two balls in each hand. Cross your 
	dominant hand over your non-dominant, but shift both hands toward the 
	dominant side of your body. Make a vertical throw from your dominant hand 
	and then, as the ball begins to descend, make the same stacked under-the-arm 
	multiplex done in the previous step from your non-dominant hand. This will 
	clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the ball thrown from your 
	dominant hand. As the bottom multiplexed ball reaches its peak, you are 
	going to again swing your dominant hand around and claw catch it, uncrossing 
	your arms in the process. However, unlike in the previous step, you are 
	going to continue circling your non-dominant hand (which is holding a ball) 
	up and around as your dominant hand makes its center vertical throw. Your 
	non-dominant hand should cross back over your dominant hand just as your 
	dominant hand is catching the top multiplexed ball. Your non-dominant hand 
	will then circle underneath the center vertical ball, releasing the ball its 
	holding and claw catching the center ball (as if juggling Rubenstein&#39;s 
	Revenge). The ball it threw will then be caught by your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/danceysdevilmentfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this on both sides. This sequence 
	represents one cycle of Dancey&#39;s Devilment. To connect both sides of the 
	pattern, you are simply going to make another stacked under-the-arm 
	multiplex, this time with your dominant hand (assuming you made the previous 
	multiplex with your non-dominant hand). You will then repeat the cycle on 
	the opposite side of your body. Assuming you are already fairly comfortable 
	with multiplexes and Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge, Dancey&#39;s Devilment will not be 
	that difficult to learn.</span></p>
