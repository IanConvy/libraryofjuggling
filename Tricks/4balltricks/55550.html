	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 55550—also known as Five 
	With a Hole—is a four ball pattern in which all throws are made as if doing 
	a Five Ball Cascade, except one of the balls is simply missing. This creates 
	a short window of time where all the balls are in the air, making the 55550 
	technically a flash. The trick is somewhat impressive on its own, but is 
	particularly valuable when practicing the Five Ball Cascade.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The learn the 55550, it is best to start with two balls 
	in each hand. Make a Cascade-like throw from your dominant hand, followed by 
	a throw from your non-dominant hand, then your dominant hand again, and 
	finally a last throw from your non-dominant hand. There should be a brief 
	period of time where neither of your hands is holding a ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/55550run.gif" width="400" />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure to pay close attention to the timing of your 
	throws. You want the period of time where all balls are in the air to be as 
	short as possible, in order make the trick appear seamless. Once you have 
	one cycle mastered, all that&#39;s left is to keep making the same set of throws 
	repeatedly and you will be running the full 55550.</p>
