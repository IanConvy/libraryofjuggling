	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Four Ball Box is, as it 
	sounds, a four 
	ball version of the Box pattern, which is normally juggled with three balls. 
	However, the Four Ball Box differs from its little brother in two major 
	respects. Unlike in the regular Box, horizontal passes do not simply 
	alternate direction, but instead occur in pairs, with two balls being tossed 
	to the same hand sequentially. Similarly, the outside throws do not simply 
	consist of one ball thrown vertically, but instead follow a Three in 
	One-style trajectory, with two balls in the air at any given time. These 
	differences make the Four Ball Box more complicated than the regular Box, 
	though the trick is still relatively easy compared to other four ball 
	patterns.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Four Ball Box, it is best to begin with a 
	simpler three ball pattern. Start with two balls in your dominant hand and 
	one ball in your non-dominant. Make two sequential throws from your dominant 
	hand, as if juggling the Three in One. As you are doing the second throw, 
	make a horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand to your dominant hand. At 
	this point, all three balls should be on the dominant side of your body. As 
	the first ball thrown approaches your dominant hand, you are going to pass 
	back the ball in that hand to your non-dominant hand, clearing space for you 
	to catch the first ball, after which you will catch the second ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballboxthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since these throws form the core of the Four Ball Box, it is 
	important that you practice them extensively on both sides. Once your are 
	proficient on each side, you can chain the two sides together. After you 
	pass back the third ball to your non-dominant hand (the last throw of the 
	previous step), you are going to throw it up in air and repeat the same 
	throws done in the previous, except on the opposite side of your body. The 
	horizontal passes should be made just after each ball from the previous step 
	returns to your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballboxthree2.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this extensively. To add in the fourth ball, start 
	with two balls in each hand. Make the same two vertical throws and 
	horizontal pass that you did in step one,&nbsp; and then, as the first ball 
	approaches your dominant hand, throw the ball in your non-dominant hand 
	vertically and make a horizontal pass from your dominant hand to your 
	non-dominant hand, clearing space for your dominant hand to catch the first 
	ball. Immediately after the ball is caught, make another vertical throw from 
	your non-dominant hand while also making a second pass to your non-dominant 
	hand using the ball that your dominant hand just caught. At this point, the 
	last vertical ball thrown from your dominant hand should be caught, and 
	there should be one ball in your non-dominant hand and two balls in the air 
	above it. As the first of those balls in the air descends toward your 
	non-dominant hand, make a pass back to your dominant hand and catch that 
	ball. Then catch the second ball that was in the air.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballboxfour.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To run the full Four Ball Box, 
	just make a vertical throw from your dominant hand as the non-dominant hand 
	is passing back its ball at the end of the step show above. This will set 
	you up to run another cycle, at which point you simply keep repeating cycles 
	and alternating sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
