	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Four Ball Mills Mess is 
	just as it sounds: a four ball version of the popular Mills Mess pattern. 
	However, unlike its little brother, the Four Ball Mills Mess is built off of 
	the Fountain, therefore the balls never actually switch hands. The Four Ball 
	Mills Mess is significantly harder to learn the the regular Mills Mess, and 
	it can take months of practice to achieve a clean and sustainable pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Four Ball Mills Mess, start with two 
	balls in your dominant hand, and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Cross 
	your dominant hand over your non-dominant hand, and then make a throw from 
	your dominant hand in the direction of your non-dominant hand. As you are 
	making that throw, uncross your arms, throwing the ball in your non-dominant 
	hand at the moment when your arms are fully uncrossed. That ball should 
	travel in the same direction as the first ball. Once that throw has been 
	made, recross your arms, this time with your non-dominant hand on top. <br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to this point, these throws and arm movements are 
	identical to the standard Mills Mess. There should be two balls in the air 
	at this point, and the first ball should be close to your hands now. You 
	will find yourself naturally wanting to catch the first ball with your 
	non-dominant hand, which is now on top, since that most closely matches the 
	three ball Mills Mess. However, you must overcome that desire and instead 
	throw the last ball in your dominant hand under the arm of your dominant 
	hand, clearing space for your dominant hand to catch the first ball. The 
	second ball should be caught by your non-dominant hand, and the third ball 
	should be caught by your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballmillsmessthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this extensively on both sides. As you likely 
	noticed, the balls don&#39;t actually switch hands, despite the arm movements. 
	This is an important thing to keep in mind; if you find that the balls are 
	in fact switching hands, it is a definitive sign that you are doing 
	something wrong.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have the above step mastered, it is time to add in 
	the fourth ball. Start with two balls in each hand, and then do the same 
	exact throws done in the previous step. However, when it comes time to catch 
	the second throw with your non-dominant hands, there should be, unlike in 
	the previous step, a ball in that hand. This ball is going to be thrown over 
	the second and third balls, and will travel in the opposite direction. Once 
	that ball has been thrown, catch the second ball as you uncross your arms 
	and then catch the third and fourth balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballmillsmessfour.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. Once you have it mastered, it is 
	time to add in the fifth throw. Notice in the previous step that when the 
	third ball is caught, there is already a ball in that hand. For the next 
	step, your are going to make a throw from that hand in the same direction as 
	the fourth throw, and recross your hands, catching the fourth throw in your 
	bottom hand and the fifth throw in your top hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballmillsmessfive.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown in the animation, practice this on both sides. Now 
	at this point, you may be able to figure out the rest of the pattern your 
	self based on the rhythm of this step. However, if you are still confused, 
	there is one more individual throw to practice. The sixth throw is made to 
	clear space for the fourth throw to be caught, and it is a full under the 
	arm throw, going the same direction as the previous two throws.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballmillsmesssix.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, practice this on both sides. By this point, it would 
	be very surprising if your body didn&#39;t naturally pick up the rhythm of the 
	pattern. However, just in case, the seventh throw is made from your top 
	hand, and signals the point where the pattern once again changes directions. 
	After the seventh throw is made, your arms uncross as they make the eighth 
	and ninth throws.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Running the full Four Ball Mills Mess for extended periods 
	takes a lot of practice, and is almost, but not quite as difficult as the 
	Five Ball Cascade. And remember, the balls never switch hands, so always 
	watch out for that as you practice.&nbsp; </p>
