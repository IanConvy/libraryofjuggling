	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cliff&#39;s Confusion is a four 
	ball multiplex pattern which resembles the three ball Mills Mess, but 
	contains an extra vertically-oriented split-multiplex in the middle of the 
	trick. I uncovered this obscure pattern from a
	<a href="http://www.toddstrong.com/">website run by Todd Strong</a>. The 
	animation I found for Cliff&#39;s Confusion shows the pattern juggled in a 
	slightly asymmetric fashion, with the multiplexes on one side of the body 
	being thrown more vertically. I couldn&#39;t figure out if this was the proper 
	form or simply an unconscious discrepancy, so I decided to focus on a 
	symmetric version (the original animation can be found by following the link 
	in the &quot;Other Tutorials&quot; box). Regardless, it is easy to transition between 
	the two forms, so learning one variation will not hamper your mastery of the 
	other.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn Cliff&#39;s Confusion, start with two balls in each 
	hand. Cross your dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand, and then 
	make a vertical under-the-arm throw from your dominant hand. As that ball 
	reaches its peak, make a stacked multiplex throw from your non-dominant hand 
	toward the center for your body, clearing space for you to catch the first 
	ball with your non-dominant hand. As that ball is being caught, uncross your 
	arms and then recross your dominant hand over your non-dominant hand, 
	catching the bottom ball from the multiplex. The top ball will then be 
	caught by your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/cliffsconfusionfour.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To connect the cycles, 
	you are going to add a third throw, made from your non-dominant hand, right 
	as that hand is catching the top ball of the multiplex. This vertical throw 
	sets you up for another multiplex, as shown in the animation below.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/cliffsconfusionfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have mastered this third throw, you simply need to 
	keep repeating the same multiplex/vertical throw pair that you practiced in 
	step one, and you will be juggling Cliff&#39;s Confusion.</p>
