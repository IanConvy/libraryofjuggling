	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 552 is a four ball pattern 
	in which each hand makes an uninterrupted pair of Cascade-like throws. This 
	gives the pattern an odd asymmetrical-yet-symmetrical feel which separates it 
	from other four ball tricks. The 552 can also be thought of as two two-ball 
	Snakes crossing paths with each other, therefore it is best that you already 
	know the three ball Snake before trying this pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the 552, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Throw the ball in your 
	non-dominant hand across your body, and then make two sequential throws from 
	your dominant hand to your non-dominant hand, clearing space for your 
	dominant hand to catch the first ball. Then catch the other two balls in 
	your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/552three.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. As you may have noticed, this is 
	really just a portion of the three ball Snake. However, it is also the 
	foundation of the 552. Once you have this step mastered, you are ready to 
	add in the fourth ball. Start with two balls in each hand, then make one 
	throw from your non-dominant hand, followed by two throws from your dominant 
	hand (just as in the previous step). As the first ball from your dominant 
	hand approaches your non-dominant hand, throw the ball the latter hand is 
	holding, clearing space for the other ball to land. Once that ball has been 
	caught, throw it back across your body, making room for the second ball from 
	your dominant hand to be caught. Then catch the rest of the balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/552run.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. Once you have it mastered, all 
	that&#39;s left to run the full 552 is to make another two throws with your 
	dominant hand after the last throw in the step above, starting another 
	cycle. This pattern is enjoyable to juggle in its own right, but is also a 
	great warm up to the Five Ball Cascade.</p>
