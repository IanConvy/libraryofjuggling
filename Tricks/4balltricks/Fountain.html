	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fountain is one of the most 
	basic four ball patterns, and almost always the first one that jugglers 
	learn. The trick itself is simply a pair of Two-in-ones being juggled 
	asynchronously (this pattern is technically called the Asynchronous 
	Fountain). Unlike many three ball tricks, the Fountain is generally not a 
	pattern that can be simply &quot;figured out,&quot; and instead often requires a few 
	weeks of practice to get mastered. Before you start learning the trick, it 
	is important for you to be able to juggle a Two-in-One with each hand, and 
	it helps to know the Half-Box (441).<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step in juggling the Fountain is to practice with 
	three balls. Start with two balls in your dominant hand, and one in your 
	other. Throw one ball from your dominant hand as if in a Two-in-one, and the 
	toss the ball in your other hand in a similar fashion. Once the first ball 
	has almost returned to your dominant hand, throw the last ball up in the 
	air, and then catch them all.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fountainthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this step extensively with both your dominant and 
	non-dominant hand leading. Remember, you will need to be able to maintain a 
	Two-in-one in each hand, so always practice with both hands equally. The 
	next step to learning the Fountain is a&nbsp; four ball version of the step 
	above, with each ball being thrown once. Start with two balls in each hand. 
	Then, throw one ball from your dominant hand, followed by one from your 
	non-dominant hand, followed by the other from your dominant hand, followed 
	by the other ball in your non-dominant hand. Catch all the balls after these 
	four throws.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fountainfour.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this extensively. Make sure to do this 
	exerice starting with each hand. After you can do this step cleanly and 
	consistently, it is only a matter of increasing the number of throws, and 
	you will be juggling the Fountain. I would recommend adding just one or two 
	throws at a time for the first few cycles, then increasing the rate as you 
	become more proficient. The Fountain is the backbone of many more advanced 
	four ball tricks, so it would be wise to invest a lot of time into mastering 
	this pattern.</p>
