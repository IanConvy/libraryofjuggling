	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arches is a synchronous four 
	ball pattern in which each hand alternates between overthrows and 
	underthrows. It can also bee seen as a Half-Shower that constantly switches 
	directions. Due to a greater risk of collisions, in addition to a more 
	complicated throwing pattern, Arches has a higher difficulty than the 
	standard Half-Shower.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn Arches, it is important that you are first able to 
	juggle the Four Ball Half-Shower in both directions (i.e. making overthrows 
	with either hand). The first step to actually learning Arches is to juggle a 
	Four Ball Half-Shower going one direction, and then switch directions by 
	shortening one of your overthrows and making a higher overthrow with the 
	hand that was, before, making underthrows. The hand that was previously 
	making an overthrow should then make an underthrow before switching back to 
	overthrows.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/archesrun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is essentially Arches with an extra pair of Half-Shower 
	throws inserted before switching sides. Once you are comfortable with this 
	slower pattern, all that&#39;s needed to run full Arches is to cut out those 
	extra throws, and switch sides continously.</p>
