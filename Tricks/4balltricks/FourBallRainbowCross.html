	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Four Ball Rainbow Cross is 
	a variation of Four Ball Columns in which the two outside balls are thrown 
	over the top of the two center balls, switching sides each time. Assuming 
	you already know Four Ball Columns and the three ball Rainbow Cross, this 
	trick is not particularly hard to figure out, as such a tutorial is really 
	not necessary. It may help to practice the regular Rainbow Cross with each 
	hand taking turns catching the center ball, just to get both hands used to 
	doing each kind of throw. </p>
