	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Synchronous Pistons is a four 
	ball trick in which two balls are thrown vertically at the same time, 
	interwoven with another pair of balls which are thrown vertically as the 
	first pair fall back down. As stated in its name, Synchronous Pistons is 
	basically just Pistons which is thrown simultaneously, instead of in a 
	staggered asynchronous pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This short tutorial is going to assume you already know Four 
	Ball Columns. If you don&#39;t, learning Synchronous Pistons is still fairly 
	intuitive, and shouldn&#39;t necessitate more than simply starting with two 
	balls in each hand and making the two pairs of throws in the proper 
	configuration. Then, simply add in extra throws as you become more 
	comfortable.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, assuming you know the Four Ball Columns, the easiest way 
	to learn this trick is to hijack the timing of the Columns trick and simply 
	shift the location of your throws and catches. Start by juggling Four Ball 
	Columns, and then take your center pair of throws and slightly angle them 
	toward a side of your body, such that one of the center balls now occupies 
	the space that would normally be taken up by one of the outside balls. Then, 
	shift your outside pair of balls such that one of them gets thrown in 
	between the first pair of balls (the ones you shifted over).<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/synchpistonsrun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After transitioning, just keep making vertical throws from 
	the same hand position, and you will be juggling Synchronous Pistons.</p>
