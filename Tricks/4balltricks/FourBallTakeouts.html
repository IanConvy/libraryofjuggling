	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four Ball Takeouts is, as it 
	sounds, a four ball version of Takeouts, accomplished by adding a 
	multiplex to the normal 423 pattern. For this reason it 
	might help to already be familiar with tricks like Cliff&#39;s Confusion, which 
	share the same style of multiplex throw. Regardless, you should definitely 
	have regular Takeouts mastered before attempting this version.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Four Ball Takeouts, start with one ball in 
	your dominant hand and two balls in your non-dominant. Cross your 
	non-dominant hand under your dominant hand, and then make a short 
	under-the-arm stacked multiplex throw from your non-dominant hand while 
	simultaneously revolving your dominant hand up and over the top multiplexed 
	ball. Catch the bottom multiplexed ball with your dominant hand as it 
	completes its revolution, and then catch the top multiplexed ball with your 
	now empty non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballtakeoutsthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown in the animation above, you will want to get to the 
	point where you can perform this step on each side of your body in rapid 
	succession. To add in the fourth ball, start with two balls in each hand. 
	Make a throw from your dominant hand toward the center of your body, and 
	then cross your non-dominant hand under your dominant hand and make an 
	under-the-arm stacked multiplex, clearing space for your non-dominant hand 
	to catch the ball previously thrown by your dominant hand. As that stacked 
	multiplex throw is being made, swing your dominant hand over and around the 
	top multiplexed ball, catching the bottom multiplexed ball as the hand 
	finishes its revolution. As that catch is being made, make a throw from your 
	non-dominant hand toward the dominant side of your body, clearing space for 
	the hand to catch the top multiplexed ball. The last ball will then also be 
	caught by your non-dominant hand (on the dominant side of your body.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballtakeoutsfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To run the full pattern, simply 
	modify the last part of the previous step so that the last ball is caught by 
	your dominant hand after it makes an under-the-arm multiplex throw on the 
	non-dominant side of your body (mirroring the second throw and first catch 
	of the sequence). Four Ball Takeouts is one of the easier four ball tricks, 
	requiring only an hour or two of practice if you are already experienced 
	with regular Takeouts. </p>
