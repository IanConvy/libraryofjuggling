	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pistons is an asynchronous four 
	ball pattern in which every ball is thrown along its own vertical path. It is 
	essentially a Fountain where the balls do not travel in circles, but are 
	instead thrown in columns. Though it may look difficult to perform, Pistons 
	is actually a fairly simple and easy trick.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before learning Pistons, it is important that you already 
	know how to do a vertical Two-in-One in each hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballcolumnstwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the full pattern, start with two balls 
	in each hand. Then, make a vertical throw with your dominant hand near the 
	center of your body. When that ball is almost at its peak, make a similar 
	throw from your non-dominant hand. When the first ball begins falling back 
	down, throw the second ball in your dominant hand vertically along the side 
	of the first ball. When the second ball (thrown from your non-dominant hand) 
	begins falling back down, throw the last ball from your non-dominant hand 
	vertically along the side of the second ball. Then catch all the balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/pistonsrun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice these first four throws, making sure to maintain 
	consistent and accurate timing. To fully run Pistons, just keep making 
	throws in the same pattern as the first four, and eventually you will get 
	into a rhythm.</p>
