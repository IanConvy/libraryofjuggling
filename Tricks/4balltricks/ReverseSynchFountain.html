	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reverse Synchronous 
	Fountain is a variation of the standard Synchronous Fountain in which the 
	balls are thrown toward the center of your body from the outside. Assuming 
	you are already comfortable with the regular Synchronous Fountain, this 
	trick should not be too difficult to learn. However, the fact that balls 
	from each side are being thrown towards each other increases the odds of 
	collision and makes the Reverse Synchronous more tricky to master than the 
	standard pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn this trick, start with two balls in each hand. Then, 
	simultaneously throw one ball from each hand toward your body, as if in a 
	reverse Two-in-one. Then, when those balls are at their peaks, throw the 
	last ball from each hand in a similar fashion as the first, catching the 
	first pair of balls and then catching the last pair.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/reversesynchfountainrun.gif" width="400" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you can do this consistently, all that&#39;s left is to keep 
	adding more throws until you are able to run the Reverse Synchronous 
	Fountain continously. </p>
