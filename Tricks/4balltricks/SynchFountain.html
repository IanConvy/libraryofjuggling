	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Synchronous Fountain is a 
	variation of the standard Fountain pattern where two balls are thrown 
	simultaneously, instead of a staggered&nbsp; timing. The trick itself is 
	slightly harder than the normal Fountain, simply because you are dealing 
	with two balls at once for each throw and each catch. Therefore, it is best 
	for you to already know the regular Fountain before learning this 
	synchronous variation, and this tutorial will assume you do.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is really only one step to learning the Synchronous 
	Fountain once you know the standard pattern Start with four balls, two in 
	each hand. Then, throw one ball from each hand simultaneously. Once those 
	balls have reached their peak, throw the last two balls up along the same 
	path, and then catch both pairs of balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/synchfountainrun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this extensively. When you feel comfortable, add in 
	a third pair of throws, then a fourth, fifth, and so on. Eventually, you 
	will be able to run the pattern for long periods of time, at which point you 
	will be juggling the Synchronous Fountain. </p>
