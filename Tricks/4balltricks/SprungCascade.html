	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sprung Cascade is a unique 
	four ball trick that is essentially the three ball Cascade with a fourth 
	ball being passed between hands with every throw. The pattern can also be 
	thought of as a Box with the vertical throws being switched to Cascade 
	throws. The Sprung Cascade is an enjoyable yet difficult pattern to juggle, 
	and looks good to spectators.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Sprung Cascade, it is best to start with an 
	adaptation of the three ball Box. Juggle a standard Box, but then make one 
	of the vertical throws from your dominant hand a high Cascade throw instead. 
	While that ball is in the air, make a second high Cascade throw with your 
	non-dominant hand, passing the remaining ball in your dominant hand to your 
	non-dominant hand, as if juggling the normal Box. Then, as the first ball 
	begin to come back down toward your non-dominant hand, pass the third ball 
	back to your dominant hand, and then catch the first ball. As the second 
	ball is approaching your dominant hand, resume juggling the standard Box by 
	making a vertical throw with your non-dominant hand paired with a horizontal 
	pass from your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/sprungcascadethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this extensively. Once you have it mastered, you are 
	ready to add in the fourth ball. Start with two balls in each hand, and then 
	make one high Cascade throw from each hand, starting with your dominant 
	hand. As the first ball approaches your non-dominant hand, make a third 
	Cascade throw from your dominant hand and pair it with a horizontal pass 
	from your non-dominant hand, clearing space in your non-dominant hand to 
	catch the first Cascade throw. As the second Cascade throw approaches your 
	dominant hand, make a fourth Cascade throw from your non-dominant hand, and 
	then make a horizontal pass from your dominant hand, clearing space to catch 
	the second Cascade throw. Then catch all the balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/sprungcascaderun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This step may take some time to master. It might help to work 
	on just doing the first Cascade/horizontal pass combination, in order to get 
	used to the throws. Only after the first one is mastered should you then try 
	chaining two together.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have the above step mastered, you need only continue 
	making Cascade/horizontal pass combinations and you will be juggling the 
	full Sprung Cascade. While practicing, you should eventually start to get 
	into a rhythm, which will make the trick much easier.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
