	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Four Ball Stacked Box is a 
	variation of the Four Ball Box that can best be conceptualized as juggling a 
	small Box underneath a much taller one. This pattern is sometimes referred 
	to as just the<em> </em>Four Ball Box, but I arbitrarily chose to call 
	(6,2x)(6,2x)* the Four Ball Box and therefore refer to this trick as the 
	Stacked variation. Terminology issues aside, the Four Ball Stacked Box is a 
	fairly difficult pattern to learn due to an intense combination of speed and 
	accuracy. <br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Four Ball Stacked Box, start with one 
	ball in each hand. Make a very high vertical throw from your dominant hand 
	while simultaneously making a horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand to 
	your dominant hand. As your dominant hand catches the passed ball you are 
	going to throw that ball vertically at roughly the same height as you would 
	if juggling the regular three ball Box pattern. This throw and the very high 
	throw should ideally peak at the same time. After catching the lower ball in 
	your dominant hand you are going to pass it back to your non-dominant hand, 
	clearing space for your dominant hand to catch the very high ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballstackedboxttwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides until the timing of all your 
	throws is comfortable and consistent. To add in the third ball start with 
	one ball in your dominant hand and two balls in your non-dominant hand. Make 
	the same high vertical throw and horizontal pass combination that you did in 
	step one and then make the lower throw underneath it, except this time 
	you will also make a simultaneous horizontal pass from your non-dominant 
	hand to your dominant hand. If you were to freeze time you should see all 
	three balls on the dominant side of your bodyâ€”one very high, one lower, and 
	one in your hand. As the lower throw descends you will pass the ball in your 
	dominant hand back to your non-dominant hand and then also pass the lower 
	ball back to your non-dominant hand to clear space for your dominant hand to 
	catch the very high ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballstackedboxthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. When you become comfortable 
	enough with performing one cycle you will then want to combine the cycles on 
	each side of your body. As you prepare to pass the second ball to your 
	non-dominant hand at the end of the cycle you will instead pair that pass with 
	a very high vertical throw from your non-dominant hand, thereby setting you 
	up to repeat the cycle on the other side of your body.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballstackedboxthreecont.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the sequence of throws is somewhat different than 
	those of the Four Ball Stacked Box, this three ball exercise is still very 
	helpful. To add in the fourth ball, start with two balls in each hand. Make 
	a very high vertical throw from your dominant hand and then follow it up 
	with a lower throw from your dominant hand and a horizontal pass from your 
	non-dominant hand. As the lower ball descends you are going to make a very 
	high throw from your non-dominant hand and a horizontal pass from your 
	dominant hand, followed by a lower throw from your non-dominant hand and a 
	second pass from your dominant hand. You will then pass back the ball in 
	your non-dominant hand and catch both the very high throw and the lower 
	throw in your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballstackedboxfour.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#39;s pretty much all there is to it. To continue the 
	pattern simply make another very high vertical throw from your dominant hand 
	along with the last horizontal pass 
	and the rest of the throws will fall into place. The Four Ball Stacked Box 
	requires quick and precise throws, a combination that will likely take you a 
	fair bit of time to master. </p>
