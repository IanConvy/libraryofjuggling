	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Four Ball Half-Mess is a 
	variation of the standard Four Ball Mills Mess in which one arm always 
	crosses over the other, creating a simpler and therefore easier pattern. 
	Despite this lower difficulty, the Four Ball Half-Mess is rarely if ever 
	learned before the full Mills Mess, and is often ignored entirely.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As is usually the case with variations, the Four Ball 
	Half-Mess is much easier to learn if you already know the Four Ball Mills 
	Mess. In fact, I was able to transition into a messy version of it without 
	any prior practice. However, this tutorial will assume you have no 
	experience with the Four Ball Mills Mess.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Four Ball Half-Mess, start with two balls in 
	your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your dominant 
	hand over your non-dominant, then make a throw across your body from your 
	dominant hand. As you are making that throw, begin to uncross your arms. 
	When your arms become level with each other, make a throw from your 
	non-dominant hand with roughly the same trajectory as the first throw. As 
	the first ball begins to descend toward your now uncrossed dominant hand, 
	you are going to make an overthrow back toward the center of your body, 
	clearing space for you to catch the first ball. You are then going to 
	recross your dominant hand over your non-dominant, catching the second ball 
	with your non-dominant hand and the third ball with your dominant.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballhalfmessthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this step until you can make all three throws and 
	catches comfortably. To add in the fourth ball, start with two balls in each 
	hand, and then make the same three throws performed in step one. This time 
	however, you are going to follow up the last throw made from your dominant 
	hand with an identical throw made from your non-dominant hand, clearing 
	space for that hand to catch the second ball. Then catch the rest of the 
	balls, with the fourth ball being caught with your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballhalfmessfour.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice these four throws until they are second nature. To 
	run the full Four Ball Half-Mess, simply cross your dominant hand back over 
	your non-dominant hand (as shown in the animation above) and make a throw 
	identical to the very first throw you made, clearing space for you to catch 
	the third ball. This throw marks the beginning of a new cycle, which is then 
	followed by another cycle and then another cycle, and so on, until you are 
	juggling the Four Ball Half-Mess continuously. </p>
