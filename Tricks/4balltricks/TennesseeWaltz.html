	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tennessee Waltz is a four 
	ball multiplex pattern reminiscent of Mills Mess. It contains three distinct 
	cycles, each one containing a Cascade/multiplex throw pair but with 
	different arm positions and direction. I found the obscure Tennessee Waltz 
	on a <a href="http://www.toddstrong.com/balljuggling/cliffsconfusion.php">
	website run by Todd Strong</a>, which contained no information regarding the 
	pattern&#39;s popularity or inventor. However, it does bear a similarity to 
	Cliff&#39;s Confusion, so the same individual may have had a hand in creating 
	both patterns.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Tennessee Waltz, it is best to begin with the 
	first cycle, and then add in the next two as you go along. Start with two 
	balls in each hand, and then cross your dominant hand underneath your 
	non-dominant hand (you could cross them in the opposite configuration if you 
	wanted, but you will need to reverse the dominant and non-dominant hands 
	whenever an instruction is given). Make a fairly vertical throw from your 
	dominant hand, and then throw a stacked multiplex from your non-dominant 
	hand while simultaneously uncrossing your arms. You will then catch the 
	lower multiplexed ball with your non-dominant hand, and then reach up and 
	grab the top multiplexed ball with your dominant hand as it begins to come 
	back down.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/tennesseewaltzone.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until your are comfortable with the two throws. 
	To add in the second cycle, you are going to make a throw from your dominant 
	hand as it reaches up to grab the top multiplexed ball. You will then make 
	an under-the-arm stacked multiplex from your non-dominant hand, clearing 
	space for the ball just thrown from your dominant hand to be caught. You 
	will then catch the bottom multiplexed ball with your non-dominant hand, and 
	then reach over and grab the top multiplexed ball with your dominant hand 
	(just as you did for the previous cycle).<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/tennesseewaltztwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, practice these throws until you can do them 
	consistently. To add in the third and final cycle, you are going to make a 
	throw back across your body from your dominant hand while it is crossed over 
	your non-dominant hand. You will then catch the top multiplexed ball with 
	your empty dominant hand, which should be uncrossing. As the ball just 
	thrown from your dominant hand approaches your non-dominant hand, you will 
	make a stacked multiplex from your non-dominant hand, clearing space for the 
	ball to be caught. You will catch the bottom multiplexed ball with your 
	non-dominant hand, and then cross your dominant hand underneath your 
	non-dominant to catch the top multiplexed ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/tennesseewaltzthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice all three of the cycles extensively. To begin a new 
	set of cycles, you simply need to make an under-the-arm throw from your 
	dominant hand before it catches the top multiplexed ball from the third 
	cycle. This will set you up to make a multiplex from your non-dominant hand 
	identical to the one thrown in the first cycle. The Tennessee Waltz is not a 
	particularly difficult pattern, but it will take some practice to perfect 
	the multiplexes. </p>
