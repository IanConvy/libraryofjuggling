	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 5551 is an asymmetric four 
	ball pattern in which three normal Cascade throws are followed by a quick 
	horizontal pass. The speed of this pattern closely matches that of the Five 
	Ball Cascade; as such it is most often learned for the sole purpose of practicing 
	that trick.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the 5551, it is best to start with two balls in each 
	hand. Make a throw from your dominant hand, followed by a throw from your 
	non-dominant hand, then another throw from your dominant hand. This should 
	leave you with three balls in the air, and one ball in your non-dominant 
	hand. Just as the first ball is approaching your non-dominant hand, make a 
	horizontal pass to your dominant hand, and catch the first ball in your 
	non-dominant hand. Then catch the remaining balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/5551run.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have this mastered, all that&#39;s left to run the full 
	5551 is to make another Cascade-like throw using the ball that was just 
	passed to your dominant hand, thus repeating the whole cycle over again. 
	Since this trick is asynchronous, you can also learn the 5551 using your 
	dominant hand to make the passes.&nbsp; </p>
