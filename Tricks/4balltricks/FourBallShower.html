	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Four Ball Shower is just as 
	it sounds: a Shower pattern with four balls. Relative to the Three Ball 
	Shower, this trick has throws that are higher and faster, making the 
	Four Ball Shower significantly more difficult than its little brother.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Four Ball Shower, it is best to start with two 
	balls in your dominant hand, and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a high 
	throw (a foot or more above your head) from your dominant hand, and then 
	quickly follow with a second high throw from your dominant hand along with a 
	near simultaneous horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand. As the first 
	ball thrown approaches your non-dominant hand, throw your last ball (the one 
	that was passed) along the same path as the previous two. Then catch all the 
	balls. If done right, there should be a brief period of time after the last 
	throw where there are no balls in any of your hands.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballshowerthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until you are able to execute all throws 
	accurately and with consistent timing. Then, take two balls in each hand, 
	and do the exact same set of throws as above, except pair the last throw of 
	the previous step with another horizontal pass using the new fourth ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballshowerrun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#39;s pretty much all there is to the Four Ball Shower. 
	Just keep adding in high throws paired with horizontal passes and, as you 
	become more comfortable, you will gradually be able to run the pattern for 
	longer periods of time.</p>
