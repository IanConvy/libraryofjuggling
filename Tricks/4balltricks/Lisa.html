	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisa is a four ball pattern 
	established by William Penman as part of his
	<a href="http://unknownjuggling.tripod.com/hurricaneseries.html">Hurricane 
	Series</a>. It is made up of three distinct throws: a vertical throw, a 
	horizontal pass, and a split-multiplex. In combination, they create a simple 
	pattern that is easy to juggle yet still impressive to watch (especially if 
	performed low and fast).<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Lisa, start with two balls in your dominant 
	hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Simultaneously make a 
	split-multiplex from your dominant hand and a horizontal pass from your 
	non-dominant hand to your dominant hand. One ball from the split-multiplex 
	should be thrown vertically, while the other should travel in an arc toward 
	your non-dominant hand. As the vertical ball descends back toward your 
	dominant hand, you are going to throw the ball in your dominant hand (which 
	was first passed from your non-dominant hand) vertically along the outside 
	of the descending ball, clearing space for that ball to be caught. Your 
	non-dominant hand will catch the other multiplexed ball. You will then catch 
	the outside ball in your dominant hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To add in the fourth ball, you 
	are going to start with two balls in each hand. Make a vertical throw from 
	your non-dominant hand and then, as that ball descends, make the 
	simultaneous pass/multiplex combination from the previous step, catching the 
	first ball you threw in your now empty non-dominant hand. As the vertical 
	ball from the multiplex descends back toward your dominant hand, you are 
	going to make a vertical throw along the outside, catching the vertical 
	multiplexed ball. The other multiplexed ball will be caught by your 
	non-dominant hand, which should already be holding a ball. As the outside 
	vertical ball thrown from your dominant hand begins to descend, you are 
	going to make a horizontal pass from your dominant hand to your non-dominant 
	hand, while simultaneously making a split-multiplex from your non-dominant 
	hand. This will clear space for the outside vertical ball to be caught in 
	your dominant hand, after which you will catch the multiplexed balls in 
	their corresponding hands.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/lisafull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To run the full 
	pattern, simply keep making horizontal pass/split-multiplex combinations 
	after each outside vertical throw. Lisa is a fairly easy pattern to master, 
	but its simplicity allows for many creative variations. </p>
