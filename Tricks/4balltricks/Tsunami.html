	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tsunami is an advanced four 
	ball pattern established by
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/dmarden117?feature=watch">Daniel Marden</a>. 
	It is a shape distortion of the 72416 siteswap, a pattern rarely juggled in 
	its standard form and not relevant to this tutorial. Though bearing some 
	resemblance to Mills Mess, Tsunami is an all together unique trick with no 
	closely related patterns or important prerequisites beyond basic familiarity 
	with four ball juggling.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Tsunami, start with one ball in each hand. 
	Make a fairly high throw from your non-dominant hand toward the center of 
	your body, and then cross your dominant hand under your non-dominant arm and 
	make a significantly higher throw from your dominant hand toward the center 
	of your body. Catch both balls in your non-dominant hand. making sure that 
	there is a reasonable amount of time between the catches.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/tsunamitwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the third 
	and fourth balls, start with two balls in each hand. Perform the same two 
	throws learned in step one and then, with one ball in each hand, you are 
	going to make a small throw from your dominant hand toward the center of 
	your body, followed closely by a horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand 
	to your now empty dominant hand. The horizontal pass should be timed such 
	that the very first ball thrown by your non-dominant hand is caught right 
	after the pass is made. Your dominant hand will then catch the ball it just 
	threw, while your non-dominant hand catches the underarm ball thrown from 
	your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/tsunamifour.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As always, practice this on both sides. You have just 
	completed one full cycle of Tsunami; the next step will focus on connecting 
	two of these cycles together. Start by repeating the same throws performed 
	in the previous step. However, before catching the small throw made by your 
	dominant hand (the throw made just before the horizontal pass), you are 
	going to make a high throw from your dominant hand toward the center of your 
	body. This throw is a mirror image of the very first throw made by your 
	non-dominant hand. You will then catch the small throw with your now empty 
	dominant hand. As the high underarm throw made by your dominant hand 
	descends you are going to perform a mirror image of that underarm throw 
	using your non-dominant hand. You will then catch the previous underarm ball 
	with your non-dominant hand, while the other two balls will be caught by 
	your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/tsunamifull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this on both sides. Notice that these 
	two additional throws are the beginning of a new cycle. To continue the 
	pattern simply make a small throw and horizontal pass and then follow that 
	up with more cycles. While not being an especially hard pattern to learn, 
	Tsunami is very difficult to master, with tricky timing and a need for 
	accurate throws. </p>
