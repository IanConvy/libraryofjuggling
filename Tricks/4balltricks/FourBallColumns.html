	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four Ball Columns is a four 
	ball variation of Columns, such that two balls are always thrown vertically 
	inside, and two are always thrown vertically outside. Once you are familiar 
	with the Synchronous Fountain, Four Ball Columns should not be a very 
	difficult trick to master.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before trying to learn Four Ball Columns, it is 
	important to make sure you can juggle a vertical Two-in-one with each hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballcolumnstwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have this mastered in on both sides, you are ready 
	to try the full pattern. Start with two balls in each hand. Simultaneously 
	make a vertical throw with each hand near the center of your body, and when 
	those balls are at their peak, simultaneously throw the last ball in each 
	hand vertically along the sides of the two center balls, and then catch all 
	the balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballcolumnsrun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#39;s all there is to Four Ball Columns. To run the full 
	pattern, just make another pair of vertical throws in the center, and keep 
	alternating between inside and outside throws. </p>
