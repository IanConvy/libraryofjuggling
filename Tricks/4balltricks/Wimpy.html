	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Wimpy pattern is a 
	synchronous four ball trick in which the balls are simultaneously thrown 
	between hands, such that they would, theoretically, overlap in the middle. 
	To avoid collisions when actually running the pattern, the balls are 
	generally thrown at slightly different heights, so that one hand always 
	throws its ball slightly higher than the other.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Wimpy pattern, it is best to start with one ball 
	in each hand. Then, simultaneously throw the two balls along a Cascade like 
	path to the other hand, making sure to throw one slightly higher to avoid 
	collisions.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/wimpytwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is pretty much the only intermediate step to learning 
	the Wimpy. After you have the two throws above mastered, just start with two 
	balls in each hand and make a second set of throws after the first set are 
	past their peak. The Wimpy pattern with any number of balls is generally 
	easier than the corresponding fountain pattern, so learning the Wimpy with 
	four balls should not be too difficult. </p>
