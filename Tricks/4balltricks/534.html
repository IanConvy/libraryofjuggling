	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 534 is a four ball siteswap 
	pattern which combines three different throws (a high Cascade throw, a low 
	Cascade throw, and a Fountain throw) to bring a more dynamic twist to the 
	standard tower siteswaps (531, 7531, etc.)<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the 534, start with two balls in your dominant hand 
	and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a high Cascade throw from your 
	dominant hand, and then immediately follow it up with a low Cascade throw 
	from your non-dominant hand (as if juggling the first two throws of the 
	531). As that low Cascade throw is in the air, make a vertical throw from 
	your dominant hand, clearing space for you to catch that low throw. Then 
	catch the first throw with your non-dominant hand (it is important to make 
	sure that this high throw is caught <em>after</em> the low second throw is 
	caught). Finally, catch the vertical throw with your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/534three.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this extensively on both sides. To add in the fourth 
	ball, you are going to make another high Cascade throw from your 
	non-dominant hand after you make the vertical throw from your dominant hand. 
	This will clear space for you to catch the first high Cascade throw, which 
	was thrown at the very beginning from your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/534four.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. As you may have 
	noticed, the last throw shown in the animation above is a mirror image of 
	the first throw you made. This means that the cycle simply repeats again, 
	this time using the opposite hands for each throw. To run the full 534, just 
	keep repeating the cycle. This is however easier said than done, since the 
	534 requires precise timing that will take many days if not weeks of 
	practice to master.</p>
