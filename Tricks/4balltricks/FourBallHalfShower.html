	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Four Ball Half-Shower is a 
	synchronous trick in which one hand makes constant overthrows while the 
	other hand makes constant underthrows. While this version of the Four Ball 
	Half-Shower is probably the most popular, there is also a slightly more 
	difficult asynchronous version (siteswap 53) in which the gap between the 
	high and low throws is much larger. <br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Four Ball Half-Shower, it is important to master 
	synchronous high-low throws, a skill that can be challenging at first. Start 
	with one ball in each hand, and then make a high overthrow with your 
	dominant hand while simultaneously making a low underthrow with your 
	non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballhalfshowertwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this pair of throws until you are very comfortable 
	with it. Then, with two balls in each hand, make one pair of throws, and 
	when they are at their peak, throw a second pair using your last two balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballhalfshowerrun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have two sets of throws mastered, you can move on to 
	three, four, and so on, until you able to juggle the Four Ball Half-Shower 
	continously. Once you have mastered making overthrows with your dominant 
	hand, you can switch sides and learn the Half-Shower going the opposite 
	direction.</p>
