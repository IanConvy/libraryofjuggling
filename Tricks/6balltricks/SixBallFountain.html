	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Six Ball Fountain is, as it 
	sounds, the six ball version of the Fountain. It is the base pattern of six 
	ball juggling, and therefore an important milestone in one&#39;s juggling 
	career. Like the Five Ball Cascade, the Six Ball Fountain is very difficult 
	and time consuming to learn, and only with dedicated practice can it be 
	mastered. Given that one does not simply learn the Six Ball Fountain in a 
	day, and seeing as how the pattern is in fact quite simple in principle, 
	this tutorial will only be able to offer basic advice to help you along.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before attempting the Six Ball Fountain it is very important 
	that you already be fairly comfortable with the Three in One using <strong>
	both</strong> hands. While outright mastery isn&#39;t really necessary, you 
	should at least be able to perform runs of 15-20 catches with good 
	consistency.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/threeinone.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you first start practicing the Six Ball Fountain it is 
	most helpful to begin with a flash, which means you will throw and catch 
	each ball once. It is important that you take time to really focus on this 
	step as it will provide you with a solid foundation for when you try to add 
	more throws. When performing the flash make sure that the balls are staying 
	on their respective sides and not crossing through the center, and that the 
	timing feels roughly balanced (it&#39;s okay if it isn&#39;t perfect).<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/6balltricks/sixballfountainsix.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you are comfortable with the flash you can begin to add 
	in more throws. Now this is where different juggling paradigms come into 
	conflict a bit. Some jugglers argue that you should engage in highly 
	structured practice, adding in only one or two throws at a time then 
	purposefully stopping. Others say that you should just try to juggle the 
	pattern for as long as possible, only stopping when you drop a ball. Both of 
	these approaches have some merit, so I personally recommend a compromise 
	method. You should not stop juggling based on a particular number of throws, 
	but instead stop when the pattern becomes unstable. For the Six Ball 
	Fountain this usually means when throws from different hands begin crossing 
	over each other. Not only does this allow you more flexibility but it also 
	allows you to practice collecting all six balls at the end of a run.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately there isn&#39;t much more to say. The Six Ball 
	Fountain is not a very hard pattern to figure out, but it can be grueling to 
	learn. Progress will likely be slower than for the Five Ball Cascade, but 
	not extremely soâ€”just try to remember that the world of six ball juggling 
	is waiting for you.</p>
