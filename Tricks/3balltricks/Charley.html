	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charley is a Mills Mess 
	variation 
	established by William Penman as part of his
	<a href="http://unknownjuggling.tripod.com/hurricaneseries.html">Hurricane 
	Series</a>. It is essentially a crossed-arm Half-Shower spliced with Mills 
	Mess, a combination that offers a variety of different throws. Before 
	learning Charley, it is important that you already be comfortable with Mills 
	Mess and both the Crossed-Arm Cascade and Crossed-Arm Reverse Cascade.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Charley, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your dominant hand 
	over your non-dominant hand, and then act as if you were starting Mills 
	Mess, throwing a ball from your dominant hand toward the center of your body 
	and uncrossing your arms. As your arms uncross, you are going to make a 
	throw from your dominant hand that is almost vertical, much more so than 
	what the second throw of Mills Mess would normally be. You will then recross 
	your arms such that your non-dominant hand is now on top, catching the first 
	ball with your non-dominant hand and then making an under-the-arm throw from 
	your dominant hand toward the center of your body. This ball will pass 
	underneath the vertically-thrown second ball, which will be caught by your 
	dominant hand. The last ball will then be caught by your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/charleythree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. Next, you are going to 
	add in the &quot;crossed-arm Half-Shower&quot; portion of the pattern. As the last 
	ball from the previous step approaches your non-dominant hand (which at this 
	point is crossed over your dominant hand), you are going to bring your 
	dominant hand in toward the center of your body and make a short vertical 
	throw underneath the aforementioned ball, catching that ball in your now 
	empty non-dominant hand. Your dominant hand (which is still crossed 
	underneath your non-dominant hand) will then make an under-the-arm throw 
	over the short vertical ball and toward your non-dominant hand, clearing 
	space for your dominant hand to catch the short vertical ball. Your 
	non-dominant hand will then catch the ball thrown from your dominant hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one cycle of Charley. To connect both sides of the 
	pattern, simply make a throw from your non-dominant hand and uncross your 
	arms again (as if starting another cycle of Mills Mess). This will set you 
	up to perform Charley on the other side of your body. Charley is only 
	difficult as you learn the order and position of the throws; once those have 
	been mastered, the trick is easy to juggle. </p>
