	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke&#39;s Shuffle (also known as 
	the Drop Box) is a variation of the classic Box pattern in which the middle 
	ball is tossed between hands using a slam throw, rather than a standard 
	horizontal pass. This trick is fast paced and looks pretty cool, especially 
	when combined with other Box patterns. Before learning Luke&#39;s Shuffle, it 
	would be wise to already know both the Box and the Shuffle, since parts of 
	both tricks are included in this pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step to learning Luke&#39;s Shuffle is to split the 
	trick roughly in half, and practice the slam throw with two balls. Start 
	with one ball in each hand. Then, throw the ball in your dominant hand 
	straight up, while simultaneously passing the ball in your other hand toward 
	your now empty dominant hand (as if juggling the normal Box). Once that 
	second ball is caught, bring that hand up over the first ball, and do a slam 
	throw out of your dominant hand, claw catching the first ball on your way 
	down.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/lukesuffletwo.gif" width="400" />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this extensively on both sides. Once you can perform 
	the slam throw consistently, it is time to add it in to the full pattern. 
	Start by juggling a normal Box, and then do a slam throw with your dominant 
	hand. After the slam throw is caught by your non-dominant hand, perform 
	another slam throw with that hand, and then return to the normal Box 
	pattern.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/lukeshufflerun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one cycle of Luke&#39;s Shuffle, and as you become more 
	comfortable with the trick, you can add in more cycles. With practice, you 
	will get to the point where you can juggle the pattern for extended periods 
	of time, at which point it is safe to say you have learned Luke&#39;s Shuffle.</p>
