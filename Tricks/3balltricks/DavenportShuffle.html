	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Davenport Shuffle is a 
	symmetrical variation of the Georgian Shuffle in which one hand makes two 
	sequential throws to itself, giving the trick an odd timing and unique feel. 
	This trick also has an asymmetrical counterpart, the Buffalo Shuffle, which 
	lacks same-hand throws, but retains the basic feel of the Davenport Shuffle.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Davenport Shuffle, it is best to start with the 
	first same-hand throw and the subsequent multiplex. Hold one ball in your 
	dominant hand and two balls in your non-dominant. Cross your arms so that 
	your dominant hand (with one ball) is on the bottom. Then, make a vertical 
	throw with your dominant hand and swing that arm around over your 
	non-dominant arm, claw catching the ball. Just as that ball is being caught, 
	make a split multiplex throw with your non-dominant hand, catching the 
	center ball with your non-dominant hand and the outside ball with your 
	dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/davenportshufflethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. Once you have it mastered, your 
	are going to add in two more throws. Instead of simply catching the 
	multiplexed balls, as done in the previous step, you are going to take the 
	hand which is currently holding a ball (the hand that didn&#39;t do the 
	multiplex) and make an overthrow, clearing space to catch the outside 
	multiplex ball. The inside multiplexed ball will be caught just like in the 
	previous step. After the overthrow reaches its peak and begins to come back 
	down, you are going to use the hand which threw the overthrow to claw catch 
	the ball. Now, at this point you should have the hand which just caught the 
	overthrow stretched across your body, and the hand which caught the inside 
	multiplex underneath and on other side of your body.&nbsp; Right as you are 
	catching the overthrow, you are going to make a throw with the bottom hand 
	(which caught the inside multiplexed ball) that is identical to the first 
	throw of the previous step. This sets you up for another cycle.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/davenportshufflerun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides, and when you are able to run a 
	single cycle smoothly, just claw catch the last throw and make another 
	multiplex to perform the full Davenport Shuffle. </p>
