	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penman&#39;s Box (unofficial name) 
	is a three ball pattern that can be thought of as either a variation of 
	Penman&#39;s Pandemonium (with which it shares a siteswap) or a variation of the 
	Box (with which it bears structural similarity). Either way, Penman&#39;s Box is 
	a fairly elegant trick that adds dynamic to the normally rigid Box pattern 
	with flourishing arm motions and underarm throws. If you are already 
	familiar with Penman&#39;s Pandemonium, this trick should be very simple to pick 
	up. However, this tutorial will assume you do not already know Penman&#39;s 
	Pandemonium (though you should be able to do the Box). <br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn Penman&#39;s Box, start with two balls in your dominant 
	hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a vertical throw from your 
	dominant hand and then, as that ball begins to descend, cross your 
	non-dominant hand under your dominant hand and make a vertical throw along 
	the outside of the first throw. This will clear space for your non-dominant 
	hand to catch the first ball. As that second vertical throw is being made, 
	swing your dominant hand up and over the first ball as it is descending, 
	weaving your hand in between that ball and the ball just thrown from your 
	non-dominant hand. Once your arm has returned to its normal position, catch 
	the second ball in your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="449" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/penmansboxthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. Once you are comfortable with 
	the vertical throws and arm flourish, you can add in the horizontal pass. 
	Start by doing the same throws from the previous step and then, after you 
	finish the arm flourish, you are going to make a vertical throw from your 
	non-dominant hand (which should now be uncrossed). Simultaneously, you are 
	also going to make a horizontal pass from your dominant hand to your now 
	empty non-dominant hand, clearing space for your dominant hand to catch the 
	underarm vertical throw made by your non-dominant hand. Then catch the third 
	vertical throw with your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/penmansboxfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To run the full 
	Penman&#39;s Box, just make another under-the-arm vertical throw (with your 
	dominant hand this time) after the last vertical throw of the previous step. 
	This will then be followed by an arm flourish and horizontal pass from your 
	non-dominant hand. </p>
