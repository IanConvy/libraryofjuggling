	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Swap Box is a three ball 
	variation of the Box pattern in which a double-pass is made underneath each 
	vertical throw. These double-passes make for a very fast-paced trick, adding 
	an extra layer of difficulty to the normal Box. Before learning the Swap 
	Box, it is important that you be already able to juggle the Shuffle-Switch, 
	a Columns variation that utilizes the double-pass, and the regular Box 
	pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Swap Box, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a vertical throw from 
	your dominant hand, and then do a quick double-pass as that ball reaches its 
	peak. As the ball descends back toward your dominant hand, make a vertical 
	throw from your non-dominant hand paired with a horizontal pass from your 
	dominant hand, clearing space for your dominant hand to catch the first 
	ball. Catch the second vertical ball with your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/swapboxthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To run the full Swap 
	Box, just make another double-pass after the second vertical throw, and then 
	simply repeat the cycle. The Swap Box is best learned with high vertical 
	throws, but for the best effect you will want to bring them down to normal 
	Box height as you become more proficient. </p>
