	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Georgian Shuffle is a three 
	ball trick that pairs a fake &quot;throw&quot; with a split multiplex to create a 
	smooth and rhythmic pattern. The Georgian Shuffle, unlike many common three 
	ball tricks like Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge or Mills Mess, mostly isolates the two 
	sides of your body, creating a unique asymmetry that is both pleasing to 
	juggle and pleasing to spectators. <br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Georgian Shuffle, it is best start with the 
	multiplex. Hold two balls in your dominant hand, and then perform a split 
	multiplex throw, where the two balls leave your hand on one horizontal 
	plane. Then, bring your dominant hand up and claw catch the innermost ball 
	at its peak, reaching your non-dominant hand around to grab the outside ball 
	as it falls back down.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/georgianshuffletwo.gif" width="400" />&nbsp;
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure to catch the inside ball using only the first three 
	fingers of your dominant hand, since you will need to use the other fingers 
	to catch a second ball. Once you have the step above mastered, you are ready 
	to add in the third ball. Start with two balls in your dominant hand, and 
	one ball in your non-dominant. Then, do a multiplex and catch the inside 
	ball just like in the previous step. Then, bring your non-dominant hand 
	around and throw the ball in that hand, clearing space to catch the outside 
	multiplexed ball. Finally, bring your dominant hand over and around the ball 
	just thrown from your non-dominant hand, and catch it.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/georgianshufflethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After you have mastered this step, the only thing left is to 
	add in a fake &quot;throw&quot; with your non-dominant hand before the multiplex. Your 
	non-dominant hand will throw a ball and then claw catch the ball right 
	after, and just as you&#39;re making that claw catch, you will perform the 
	multiplex and subsequent throws/catches, before making a second fake &quot;throw&quot; 
	after making the last catch shown in the previous step.</p>
