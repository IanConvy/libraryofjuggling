	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Overthrow variation of 
	Columns is a trick in which the center ball, normally thrown vertically, is 
	instead thrown back and forth over the two outside balls. This is a fairly 
	easy pattern to learn, therefore an in-depth tutorial is not really necessary. 
	Just start out juggling the normal Columns, and then make an overthrow with 
	the inside ball. It may take a couple of tries for you to figure out how 
	strongly to throw the ball with each hand, but after that you should have no 
	problems.</p>
