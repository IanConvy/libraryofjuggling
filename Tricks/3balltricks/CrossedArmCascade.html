	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Crossed-Arm Cascade is a 
	variation of the normal Cascade in which all the throws and catches are made 
	with crossed arms. This makes the pattern very awkward, but does not 
	significantly alter its overall shape. The Crossed-Arm Cascade is harder 
	than the regular Cascade, but should only take at most a couple of days to 
	master.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Crossed-Arm Cascade, start with one ball in each 
	hand. Cross your dominant hand over your non-dominant, and then make a throw 
	from your dominant hand toward your non-dominant hand. As the ball is 
	reaching its peak, make a throw from your non-dominant hand to your dominant 
	hand, clearing space for your non-dominant hand to catch the first ball. The 
	second ball will then be caught by your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmcascadetwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides (with the same arm arrangement). 
	After you can make these two throws and catches comfortably, you are ready 
	to add in the third ball. Start with two balls in your dominant hand and one 
	ball in your non-dominant. Make the same two throws performed in the first 
	step, and then make a third throw from your dominant hand, clearing space 
	for that hand to catch the second throw, made from your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmcascadethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once these first three throws are mastered, you simply need 
	to keep making alternating throws from each hand, as if juggling the normal 
	Cascade.</p>
