	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Backcrosses is variation on the 
	normal Cascade pattern where each throw is made behind your back, with the 
	ball traveling over your shoulder, and caught in front. Despite its overall 
	simplicity, Backcrosses is difficult to master, often requiring a month or 
	more of practice to achieve proficiency.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn Backcrosses, it is important to first make sure that 
	you can throw a ball behind your back properly. Start with one ball in your 
	dominant hand. Then, bend your arm behind your back and throw the ball, 
	crossing it over your other shoulder and catching it with your non-dominant 
	hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/backcrossesone.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this throw on both sides until you can perform it 
	consistently. The next step is to add in a second ball. Start with one ball 
	in each hand. Then, make a normal Cascade throw with your non-dominant hand. 
	Quickly make a behind the back throw with your dominant hand, and then catch 
	the first ball. Catch the second ball with your non-dominant hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, practice this on both sides until you can do it 
	smoothly and consistently. Now all that&#39;s left is to add in the third ball. 
	Start by juggling a normal Cascade, and then make a single behind the back 
	throw. Catch the ball and resume juggling the Cascade.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/backcrossesthree.gif" width="317" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this integration on both sides. Once you are 
	comfortable with a single throw, try to perform constant behind the back 
	throws on one side, similar to a half-shower.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/backcrossesrun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you can run this Backcrosses half-shower on each side, 
	all that&#39;s left is to do behind the back throws continuously. It is best to 
	start with just two or three throws in a row at first, and then gradually 
	work your way up to the full Backcrosses. This trick can be hard on your 
	shoulders at first, so make sure to take some breaks during practice.</p>
