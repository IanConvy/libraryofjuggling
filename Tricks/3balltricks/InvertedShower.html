	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Inverted Shower is a very 
	dramatic shape distortion of the Cascade. In the trick, one hand is 
	constantly catching and carrying balls horizontally above the pattern, while 
	the other hand is catching and returning the balls to the hand on top. While 
	the Inverted Shower may not seem particularly difficult, the speed and 
	accuracy required to run the pattern make it one of the most difficult three 
	ball tricks out there.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is really only one intermediate step to practice when 
	learning the Inverted Shower. Start by juggling a normal Cascade, and then 
	raise one of the balls up and over your non-dominant hand using your 
	dominant hand. Make an under-the-arm throw with your non-dominant hand, and 
	then drop the ball in your dominant hand down toward your non-dominant hand. 
	Using your dominant hand, you will then claw catch the under-the-arm throw 
	made by your non-dominant hand, and resume juggling the Cascade.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/invertedshowerthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this transition until your are very comfortable with 
	it. After that first claw catch, you simply need to keep carrying balls with 
	your dominant hand and feeding them in with your non-dominant hand. Despite 
	the simplicity of the pattern, the Inverted Shower will take a large amount 
	of practice to master. It would probably be best to begin with just two 
	cycles, and then as your skill level increases you can keep adding in more 
	cycles until you are juggling the Inverted Shower continuously. </p>
