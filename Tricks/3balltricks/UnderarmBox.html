	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Underarm Box is a variation 
	of the Box in which one of the vertical throws of each cycle is thrown 
	under-the-arm, meaning both vertical balls are on the same side of your 
	body. The position alternates sides every cycle, with a normal Box throw 
	connecting the two sides. The Underarm Box is similar to the Burst Box, 
	except that this trick lacks an under-arm catch of any vertical ball.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Underarm Box, start with one ball in each hand. 
	Cross your non-dominant hand underneath your dominant hand and make a 
	vertical throw. Simultaneously, make a horizontal pass from your dominant 
	hand while rapidly uncrossing your non-dominant hand to position it on the 
	non-dominant side of your body, where you will catch the pass. The vertical 
	ball will then be caught by your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/underarmboxtwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To add in the third ball, start 
	with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make 
	a vertical throw from your dominant hand relatively close to the center of 
	your body, and then, as that ball begins to descend back toward your 
	dominant hand, cross your non-dominant hand underneath your dominant hand 
	and make a second vertical throw at the very outside of your body. As in the 
	previous step, you are also going to simultaneously make a horizontal pass 
	from your dominant hand which will be caught by your non-dominant hand after 
	it uncrosses. Both vertical balls will then be caught by your dominant hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, practice this on both sides. To run the full Underarm 
	Box, just make another vertical throw from your non-dominant hand (at this 
	point it is uncrossed) paired with a horizontal pass from your dominant 
	hand. This will set you up for the next cycle, with your dominant hand 
	catching the second vertical throw from the previous cycle and then crossing 
	under your non-dominant hand to make another vertical throw. </p>
