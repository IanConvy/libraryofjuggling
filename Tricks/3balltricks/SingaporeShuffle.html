	Loh Koah Fong,</span> is a symmetrical variation of the Georgian Shuffle 
	where all throws are made under the arm, including the fake &quot;throw&quot; and the 
	multiplex. This separates it from the closely related Davenport Shuffle, 
	which utilizes an overthrow to catch one of the multiplexed balls.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Singapore Shuffle, it is best to start with two 
	balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your 
	arms so that the dominant hand, which is holding two balls, is underneath 
	your non-dominant hand. Then, make a multiplex throw from your dominant hand 
	and uncross your arms. Catch the outermost multiplexed ball with your 
	dominant hand, and then make a vertical throw with your non-dominant hand, 
	clearing space for that hand to catch the remaining multiplexed ball. Then 
	catch the final ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/singaporeshufflethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. Once you have it mastered, you 
	are ready to run a full cycle. Instead of letting the vertical ball simply 
	fall back into your hand, as done in the previous step, you are going to 
	bring the hand that threw&nbsp; it around and over your other arm, claw 
	catching the ball about halfway down its descent. Just as that ball is being 
	caught, make a throw from your other hand underneath the arm of the hand 
	which just claw caught the vertical ball. Then, bring the hand which just 
	made the under the arm throw around and up over the other hand, claw 
	catching the ball it just threw.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/singaporeshufflerun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice a full cycle on each side. Then, to pair them 
	together and run the full Singapore Shuffle, just throw another multiplex 
	after the final claw catch. It may help to remember that the hand which 
	throws the multiplex is always the hand that catches the outside multiplexed 
	ball.</p>
