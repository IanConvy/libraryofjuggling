	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kato&#39;s Crux is a three ball 
	pattern established by
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Idiosensory">Idiosensory</a>. The trick simultaneously combines high vertical throws with 
	rapid catches, creating a structure sort of similar to that of the Sandbox Shuffle. 
	Kato&#39;s Crux has no obvious peers, therefore it is an orphan pattern with no 
	clear prerequisites beyond basic familiarity with three ball juggling.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Kato&#39;s Crux, start with one ball in each 
	hand. Cross your non-dominant hand over your dominant hand and then rotate 
	your non-dominant hand so that your palm is facing downward. Then make a fairly 
	high throw from your dominant hand along the center of your body while basically dropping the ball in your 
	non-dominant hand (you should still give the ball a bit of upward movement). In 
	the same motion you are going to uncross and then recross your arms such 
	that your dominant hand is on top, catching the &quot;dropped&quot; ball with your 
	dominant hand as it recrosses. The high ball will then be caught 
	under-the-arm by your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/katoscruxtwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the third 
	ball, start with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your 
	non-dominant hand. Cross your arms so that they are in the same starting 
	configuration as step one, and then make a fairly high under-the-arm 
	vertical throw from your dominant hand along the non-dominant side of your 
	body. As this ball reaches its peak and begins to descend, you are going to 
	perform the same throws and catches made in step one, except as you 
	uncross your arms you are going to snatch the first ball you threw out of 
	the air before recrossing your arms.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/katoscruxthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. You have essentially 
	completed one full cycle of Kato&#39;s Crux. To connect two cycles together, 
	just make a fairly high under-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand such 
	that it mirrors the very first throw you made (with your dominant hand) 
	before catching the center ball. This will set you up to do another cycle on 
	the the opposite side of your body. Kato&#39;s Crux is not a particularly 
	difficult trick to perform, though it will take time to become comfortable 
	with the various throw heights. </p>
