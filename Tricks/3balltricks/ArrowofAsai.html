	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Arrow of Asai is a three 
	ball juggling pattern established by
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/dmarden117?feature=watch">Daniel Marden</a>, 
	who specializes in multiplex juggling. It combines a stacked multiplex with 
	rapid passes, creating a surprisingly fast-paced pattern. The speed of the 
	trick, along with its almost paradoxical high throws, gives the Arrow of 
	Asai an unusual juggling aesthetic.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Arrow of Asai, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a stacked multiplex 
	throw from your dominant hand such that the balls are about 12 inches (30 
	cm) apart. As the top ball reaches its peak, make a slam throw (a pass 
	directed diagonally downward) from your non-dominant hand to your dominant 
	hand. The slam should be caught by your dominant hand at a height slightly 
	greater than the peak of the lower multiplexed ball. After making the slam, 
	your non-dominant hand should then claw catch the bottom multiplexed ball 
	(in a manner similar to what would be done in the Shuffle pattern). After 
	catching the slammed ball, your dominant hand will then be pulled between 
	the upper and lower multiplexed balls such that it crosses over your 
	non-dominant hand. The upper multiplexed ball will then be caught 
	under-the-arm by your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/arrowofasaithree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. In the next step we 
	will add in the other vertical throw and the circular arm flourish. Start by 
	doing the same throws described in step one and then, as the upper 
	multiplexed ball descends toward your non-dominant hand (which should at 
	this point still be underneath your dominant hand), make a vertical throw 
	from your non-dominant hand along the outside of the descending ball, 
	clearing space for your non-dominant hand to catch the ball. As that 
	vertical throw is being made, your dominant hand is going to swing around 
	and pass between the vertical ball just thrown and the caught multiplexed 
	ball. The vertical ball will then be caught by your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/arrowofasaithree2.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. For the final step, we are going 
	to add the horizontal pass. Start by repeating the previous step and then, 
	as your dominant hand finishes its flourish, you are going to make a 
	close-range pass from your dominant hand to your non-dominant hand, which 
	should already be holding a ball. This will clear space for your dominant 
	hand to catch the vertical ball thrown previously by your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/arrowofasaifull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this single cycle of the pattern on each side. To 
	run the full Arrow of Asai, simply make another multiplex throw before 
	catching the vertical ball. The timing between the multiplex throw and the 
	vertical ball catch is a grey area, since it is possible to make the 
	multiplex shortly <em>after</em> the other ball is caught, although this 
	breaks up the pattern and renders it non-continuous. For the greatest 
	effect, it is probably best that you make the multiplex either before or at 
	the same time as the vertical ball is caught. However, when first learning 
	the pattern it is best that you not worry about the timing until you have a 
	good grasp on the rest of the trick.</p>
