	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The True Box (unofficial name), 
	also called Box with a Lid, is an extreme shape distortion of the regular 
	Box pattern in which one ball is caught and passed in the air to create a 
	rectangle (with the ball being manipulated at the corners of the shape). 
	Despite its bizarre appearence, the True Box actually has the same siteswap 
	as the normal Box, with some of the horizontal passes performed vertically 
	instead. <br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the True Box, start with one ball in each hand. 
	Simultaneously throw both balls vertically, then quickly reach your dominant 
	hand over and grab the ball thrown from your non-dominant hand. If done 
	correctly, this ball should be caught before the other ball reaches its 
	peak. As that other ball descends, move your dominant back down and catch 
	it.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/trueboxtwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This aerial catch will likely feel very awkward at first, but 
	with practice you will eventually master the timing. To add in the next 
	throw, you are going to again start with one ball in each hand, and then 
	perform the same vertical throws and catches you did in previous step. This 
	time however, you are also going to throw the ball you caught in the air 
	over to the other side of your body. This will clear space for your dominant 
	hand to catch the other vertical ball. As the ball that was caught and then 
	thrown by your dominant hand reaches the other side of your body, bring your 
	non-dominant hand up and catch it.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/trueboxtwo2.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this until you feel comfortable with the 
	throws. To add in the third ball, start with two balls in your non-dominant 
	hand and one ball in your dominant. Make the same throws and catches as in 
	the previous step, but this time make a vertical throw from your 
	non-dominant hand before using it to catch the ball in the air (this happens 
	after your dominant hand catches and then throws that same ball). As a 
	general rule, all vertical throws made in this pattern should be the same 
	height. As that last vertical throw reaches its peak and begins to descend 
	(your non-dominant hand should have just caught the ball in the air), you 
	are going to drop the ball from your non-dominant hand and then bring it 
	back down to catch the vertical throw.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/trueboxthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The step described above contains all the throws and catches 
	performed in the air, which together make up the primary pattern. However, 
	to connect the various cycles, you will also need perform a normal 
	horizontal pass/vertical throw combination. To add this in, you are going to 
	repeat the process from the previous step, and then, as the ball that has 
	been in the air the entire time begins to finally descend toward your 
	dominant hand, you will make a vertical throw from your dominant hand. This 
	will clear space for that hand to catch the other ball. As the ball just 
	thrown begins to descend, you are going to make a horizontal pass from your 
	dominant hand and a vertical throw from your non-dominant hand (this throw 
	should be made close to the center of your body).<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/trueboxfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The animation above demonstrates one full cycle of the True 
	Box. To run the full pattern, just make another pair of simultaneous 
	vertical throws as that last throw from the previous cycle approaches your 
	non-dominant hand. The True Box is not an easy pattern, and will take time 
	to learn, especially if your goal is to create a clean rectanglular shape.&nbsp; </p>
