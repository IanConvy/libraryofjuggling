	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke&#39;s Lobotomy is a three ball 
	pattern established by <a href="http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Luke_Burrage">Luke 
	Burrage</a>. While fairly simple overall, the trick is hard to describe, as 
	it combines an odd Crossed-Arm Reverse Cascade variation (where all the 
	throws and catches are made &quot;over-the-arm&quot;) with under-the-arm throws 
	reminiscent of the Buffalo Shuffle.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Luke&#39;s Lobotomy, start with two balls in 
	your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your dominant 
	arm over your non-dominant arm, and then perform a high throw toward the 
	center of your body from your dominant hand while simultaneously making a 
	short under-the-arm vertical throw from your non-dominant hand. After making 
	these throws, uncross and then recross your arms such that your non-dominant 
	hand is now on top, and then use that hand to catch (claw catch is probably 
	easiest) the ball it had thrown under-the-arm. You will then catch the high 
	ball using your non-dominant hand as well.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. For the next step you 
	are going to link the two sides together. Start by performing the same pair 
	of throws that you did in the previous step, but instead of simply waiting 
	to catch the high throw you will instead make another pair of throws, this 
	time with your non-dominant hand making the high throw. The previous high 
	throw will then be caught by your now empty non-dominant hand as your arms 
	uncross and recross, putting your dominant hand back on top where it can 
	catch its under-the-arm throw. You will then catch the high throw from your 
	non-dominant hand with your dominant hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. By now your body should begin to 
	automatically continue the pattern, as it simply keeps making alternating 
	pairs of throws. While Luke&#39;s Lobotomy is a fairly easy pattern, the trick 
	has a unique look and feel that makes it pleasing to both watch and juggle. </p>
