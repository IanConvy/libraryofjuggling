	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shuffle is the base pattern for a type of throw called 
	the Slam. It involves raising your hand up and forcing the ball diagonally 
	towards the other hand, similar to the horizontal passes seen in the Shower. 
	This type of throws feels good to juggle, and looks great to an audience.<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Breaking the pattern down, we can see that the Shuffle is actually very 
	similar to the Shower (they even have the same siteswap). The only 
	difference is that instead of making the horizontal pass underneath the 
	pattern, the Shuffle makes the pass through it (Slam throw). Knowing this, 
	it would be best to start out by learning Slams. Start with one ball in each 
	hand. From your non-dominant hand, you are going to throw one ball across 
	your body. Then bring your dominant hand down on top of it, throwing the 
	ball currently in that hand downward to your non-dominant hand, and catching 
	the first ball:<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Practice this a lot! The throw will likely feel very weird at first, but you 
	will need to be comfortable with it in order to juggle the Shuffle. For the 
	next step, you are going to use three balls—one ball in your dominant hand, 
	two in your non-dominant. Throw one ball from from your non-dominant hand, 
	and wait for it to reach the peak of its path (like in step one). Then, you 
	are going to throw the second ball in your non-dominant hand, and then 
	immediately after you are going to make a Slam throw with your dominant 
	hand: <br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Like many other tricks, the Shuffle is all about timing. Practice this 
	second step until you you can perform it smoothly without dropping. After 
	that you simply keep adding in extra throws. Start with two, practice, and 
	then move on to three. Gradually—and I do emphasize the word gradually—you 
	will start being able to run the Shuffle longer and longer. It is also worthwhile to learn the Shuffle using your non-dominant hand, as the Slam 
	throw is used in tricks that require both hands. </p>
