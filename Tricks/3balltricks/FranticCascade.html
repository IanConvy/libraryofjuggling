	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Frantic Cascade 
	(unofficial name) is a three ball variation of the Crossed-Arm Cascade in 
	which every catch is made under-the-arm (or more accurately 
	under-the-wrist). This leads to a very quick pattern as your hands rush to 
	catch each ball. The name &quot;Frantic Cascade&quot; is one of my own creation, 
	since the trick is otherwise often referred to by the lengthy &quot;crossed-arm 
	cascade with continuous under-the-wrist catches.&quot; Before learning this 
	pattern, it is important that you already be able to juggle the regular 
	Crossed-Arm Cascade using both arm configurations.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Frantic Cascade, start with two balls 
	in your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your dominant 
	arm over your non-dominant arm and then make a throw from your dominant hand 
	toward the dominant side of your body (as if doing the Crossed-Arm Cascade). 
	Follow this up with a corresponding throw and catch from your non-dominant 
	hand. So far this has all been identical to the Crossed-Arm Cascade. 
	However, as the ball thrown from your non-dominant hand begins to descend, 
	you are going to make another throw from your dominant hand and then quickly 
	uncross and recross it underneath your non-dominant hand, catching the ball 
	thrown from your non-dominant hand. The ball just thrown will then be caught 
	by your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/diadochiccascadethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. Next, you are going to 
	add in another throw/under-the-wrist catch combination, this time from your 
	non-dominant hand. As the last ball thrown in the previous step begins to 
	descend, make a throw from your non-dominant hand and then uncross and 
	recross your non-dominant hand underneath your dominant hand (i.e. in the 
	same position as you first started), catching the descending ball 
	under-the-wrist.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/franticcascade.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To run the full pattern, simply 
	keep making throws paired with under-the-wrist catches. The Frantic Cascade 
	will take some time to master, as it has a very rapid pace. </p>
