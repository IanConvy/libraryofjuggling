	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nelson&#39;s Nemesis is a three 
	ball pattern that basically fuses Columns and Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge together 
	into one trick. It combines simultaneous vertical throws with revolving arm 
	motions to create a unique juggling aesthetic. Nelson&#39;s Nemesis is not a 
	particularly difficult pattern, but its throws might be slightly confusing 
	at first.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn Nelson&#39;s Nemesis, start with two balls in your 
	non-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant. Make one vertical throw 
	from each hand simultaneously (as if doing Columns), and then bring your 
	dominant hand up and grab the ball thrown from your non-dominant hand at its 
	peak. Let the other ball begin to descend, and then reach your non-dominant 
	hand (which is still holding a ball) over across your body to the outside 
	and make a vertical throw. This will clear space for you to catch the other 
	vertical ball. Then catch the last ball with your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/nelsonsnemesisthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. Once you have these 
	two synchronous throws mastered, the only thing left to learn is the arm 
	flourish. In the previous step, you may have noticed that after the second 
	ball has been caught and the third ball has been thrown, there is a period 
	of time where both hands are idle. Instead of just having your arms sit 
	there, you are going bring your dominant hand (which at this point has just 
	grabbed one of the vertical balls) up and around the center of your body. 
	Once your non-dominant hand has caught the other vertical ball (right after 
	throwing the third ball), it too will be swung around the center of your 
	body in a circle. This flourish should be practically identical to the one 
	performed in Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge. Once your dominant hand has circled down 
	to the center of your body, you are going to make a roughly vertical throw. 
	If timed correctly, your dominant hand should then be free to catch the 
	third ball. The last ball will then be caught by your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/nelsonsnemesisfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. Notice that after the 
	flourish and vertical throw, you will have one ball in each hand. To start a 
	new cycle of the pattern, make another pair of simultaneous throws, catching 
	the last vertical ball in the same hand that threw it (in this case, your 
	dominant hand). You will then reach up and grab one of the vertical balls 
	and make the same set of throws as done in the previous steps, using the 
	opposite hand for each throw. If you are having trouble figuring out the 
	throws of Nelson&#39;s Nemesis, watch the full trick animation at the top of 
	this page very closely, making sure to track each individual ball throughout 
	the pattern.</p>
