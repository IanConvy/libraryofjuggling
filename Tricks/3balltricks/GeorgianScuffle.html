	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Georgian Scuffle is a 
	variation of the Georgian Shuffle established by
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thegoheads">Steve Hoggan</a> that 
	combines the claw catch midair stalls of the Kraken with the asymmetric 
	multiplex and fake throw of the Georgian Shuffle. This fusion of parts from 
	two very different tricks results in a pattern with a highly distinct timing 
	and feel. Before attempting the Georgian Scuffle, you should already be very 
	familiar with the Georgian Shuffle. Experience with the Kraken will also 
	make the pattern much easier to learn, though this is not required.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Georgian Scuffle, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a fake throw from your 
	non-dominant hand back to itself (as would be done in the Georgian Shuffle) 
	and then, as you catch the ball, make a split multiplex from your dominant 
	hand. As the balls reach their peak, claw catch the ball furthest from your 
	dominant hand with that hand. As you claw catch the 
	multiplexed ball, you are going to make an under-the-arm vertical throw 
	from your non-dominant hand along the dominant side of your body, clearing 
	space for your non-dominant hand to catch the other multiplexed ball (the 
	one that was closest to your dominant hand). So far these throws and catches 
	have been identical to those in the Georgian Shuffle. <br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As that vertical ball reaches 
	its peak, you are going to basically drop the ball in your dominant hand 
	(you will still give the ball a bit of upward motion as you release it) and 
	then use that same hand to claw catch the vertical ball. As the ball dropped 
	from your dominant hand approaches your non-dominant hand, you are going to 
	make a throw along the center of your body using your non-dominant hand, 
	which will then catch the ball dropped from your dominant hand. The center 
	ball will then be caught by your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/georgianscufflethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until you can perform and catch all the throws 
	consistently, especially the midair drop. For the next step you are going to 
	add in a second midair drop from your dominant hand, using the ball that was 
	caught after the first midair drop (the ball that was grabbed from the air 
	awkwardly at the end of the previous animation). After performing the drop, 
	you are going to claw catch the center ball thrown from your non-dominant 
	hand out of the air. Simultaneously, you are going to bring your 
	non-dominant hand, which should have recently caught a ball, over to the 
	dominant side of your body, where it will make a vertical throw along the 
	outside of the ball your dominant hand dropped. This will clear space for 
	your non-dominant hand to catch that dropped ball. You will then take your 
	dominant hand, which just caught the center ball, and circle it over and 
	around the vertical ball just thrown from your non-dominant hand, catching 
	it as you finish.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/georgianscufflefinal.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To run the full pattern, simply make another fake throw from 
	your non-dominant hand as your dominant hand is catching the final ball. 
	This will set you up for the next cycle. The Georgian Scuffle benefits from 
	a quick pace, so you will want to make the pattern as small and fast as 
	possible.&nbsp; </p>
