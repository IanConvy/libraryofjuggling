	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frances is a variation of the 
	Sandbox Shuffle established by William Penman as part of his
	<a href="http://unknownjuggling.tripod.com/hurricaneseries.html">Hurricane 
	Series</a>. While maintaining the vertical pass of its parent pattern, 
	Frances adopts an arm configuration very similar to that of Romeo&#39;s Revenge. 
	As a result, you should know both the Sandbox Shuffle and Romeo&#39;s Revenge 
	before attempting this trick.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Frances, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your dominant hand 
	underneath your non-dominant hand, and then make a vertical throw. Uncross 
	and then recross your hands, bringing your dominant hand down on top of the 
	vertically thrown ball as it is descending. Then make a vertical throw from 
	your non-dominant hand on the dominant side of your body, clearing space for 
	the hand to catch the first vertical ball. After that catch has been made, 
	your dominant hand should hovering above your non-dominant hand. Make a 
	simultaneous vertical throws from each hand such that the ball from your 
	non-dominant hand is passed to your dominant hand, and the ball in your 
	dominant hand is thrown into the air. With your now empty non-dominant hand, 
	catch the second ball you threw and then catch the top ball from the pair of 
	vertical throws.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/gnomevariationthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To run the full 
	pattern, simply make another vertical throw with your non-dominant hand on 
	the dominant side of your body and catch the top ball from the pair of 
	vertical throws. This sets you up for another cycle, since you only need to 
	swing your non-dominant hand up and over the vertical ball just thrown (as 
	you did in step one), and then do another pair of vertical throws. </p>
