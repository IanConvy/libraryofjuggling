	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harrison&#39;s Hang is a three ball 
	pattern established by Danny Harrison. It can almost be thought of as 
	Penman&#39;s Pandemonium grafted onto a 441 base, though this description isn&#39;t 
	entirely accurate. You will therefore want to be very comfortable with both 
	of these tricks before attempting Harrison&#39;s Hang.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Harrison&#39;s Hang, start with two balls in 
	your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Shift your 
	dominant hand over to the non-dominant side of your body, and then raise 
	your non-dominant hand such that it is positioned over your dominant hand. 
	Make a throw from your dominant hand toward the center of your body while 
	simultaneously swinging your non-dominant hand around in a three-quarter 
	circle such that it passes inside of, under, and then outside of the ball 
	your dominant hand just threw. As that ball descends and as your 
	non-dominant hand completes its partial circle you are going to move your 
	dominant hand directly underneath your non-dominant hand, and then make a 
	vertical pass from your dominant hand to your non-dominant hand, clearing 
	space for your dominant hand to catch the first ball it threw. At the same 
	time you will make a vertical throw from your non-dominant hand (with your 
	palm facing down), clearing space for your non-dominant hand to catch the 
	vertical pass. Your non-dominant hand will then catch its vertical throw.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/harrisonshangthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. You have basically 
	performed one full cycle of Harrison&#39;s Hang. To connect two cycles together 
	(i.e. to connect both sides of the pattern) you are going to take your 
	non-dominant hand, which just caught the vertical pass, and cross it over to 
	the dominant side of your body; you will then make a throw from your 
	non-dominant hand toward the center of your body. At the same time you will 
	raise your dominant hand and begin moving it in the same three-quarter 
	circle that your non-dominant hand did at the very beginningâ€”rotating 
	inside of, under, and then outside of the ball thrown by your non-dominant 
	hand. Your non-dominant hand will then catch the ball it threw.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/harrisonshangfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice that the last throw and its accompanying arm flourish 
	are a mirror image of what you did at the beginning; to continue that 
	pattern simply make another vertical pass (from your non-dominant hand to 
	your dominant hand this time) and proceed from there. Harrison&#39;s Hang is a 
	fairly easy yet fun pattern to juggle, especially if you enjoy vertical 
	passes. </p>
