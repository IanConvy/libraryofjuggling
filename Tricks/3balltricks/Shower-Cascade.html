	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shower Cascade is a shape 
	distortion of the three ball Shower in which one ball is thrown in the 
	opposite direction of a normal Shower, giving the pattern a Cascade-like 
	shape. This throw, called a Tossout, forces your receiving hand to cross 
	underneath your throwing hand, making the horizontal passes more difficult 
	than those in a regular Shower.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Shower Cascade, start by juggling the standard 
	Shower. Then, make a throw from your dominant hand (which should be making 
	the high throws) in the opposite direction of all the others, such that it 
	travels away from your non-dominant hand. You are then going to make 
	another, normal, throw from your dominant hand. As that throw is being made, 
	your are going to start crossing your non-dominant hand underneath your 
	dominant hand, preparing to catch the outward ball. As you are bringing that 
	hand over, make a horizontal pass to your dominant hand, and then catch the 
	outside ball. Stop juggling at this point.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/showercascadethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure you are comfortable with both the Tossout and 
	subsequent horizontal pass, since these throws will need to be done without 
	hesitation. To run the full Shower Cascade, you are going to make a normal 
	Shower throw from your dominant hand after your non-dominant hand has caught 
	the tossed-out ball. Then, you are going to uncross your non-dominant hand, 
	passing its ball to your dominant hand as they pass by each other. You can 
	then resume juggling the normal Shower.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/showercascadefull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#39;s pretty much all there is to it. The full Shower 
	Cascade has a Tossout after every two throws, so the same ball will be used 
	each time. This pattern looks best when the Tossout is almost equal in 
	distance from the throwing hand as the normal throws are, since that most 
	closely imitates the two arches of the Cascade pattern.</p>
