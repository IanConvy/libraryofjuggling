	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fake Columns is a variation 
	of Columns (or more accurately the Two-in-one) in which one outer ball is 
	moved by hand along the same horizontal level as the other. This creates a 
	very cool effect, especially when used inside a normal Columns pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the trick, it is best to start out juggling a 
	Two-in-one with column throws, with a third ball sitting in your 
	non-dominant hand. As you are about to make an outside column throw, start 
	moving your non-dominant hand along with the thrown ball, making sure to 
	keep them level. Once the thrown ball has dropped back to your hand, 
	continue with the Two-in-one pattern.<img alt=""  height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/fakecolumnsrun.gif" width="400" class="smallanim" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the regular Two-in-one part as a recovery period, and 
	then do another fake. Keep practicing until you can do the Fake Columns 
	constantly.</p>
