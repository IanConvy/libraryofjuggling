	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Penman&#39;s Pandemonium is a three 
	ball pattern established by
	<a href="http://unknownjuggling.tripod.com/hurricaneseries.html">William 
	Penman</a> that includes a vertical throw/pass combination combined with 
	revolving arm movements similar to Orka&#39;s Mess. Penman&#39;s Pandemonium is one 
	of simplest patterns that includes a vertical pass, since its only other 
	distinct throws are made in a u-shape along the outside of the pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn Penman&#39;s Pandemonium, it is best to begin with the 
	vertical pass and arm motion. Start with one ball in each hand, and then 
	bring both hands to the center of your body, placing your dominant hand 
	about twelve inches above your non-dominant hand. Then, simultaneously throw 
	each ball upwards. The ball from your non-dominant hand should be passed 
	right to your dominant hand, while the ball from your dominant hand should 
	stay in air longer. During that time, you are going to swing your dominant 
	hand up and over the ball as it is coming back down, finally catching it 
	with your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/penmanspandemoniumtwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the third 
	ball, start with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your 
	non-dominant. Cross your dominant hand underneath your non-dominant, and 
	then make a vertical throw. Then uncross your arms and position your 
	dominant hand directly above your non-dominant hand, and make the two 
	vertical throws made in step one. This will clear space for you to catch the 
	very first ball with your non-dominant hand. After making the pair of 
	vertical throws, swing your dominant hand up and over the top ball (as done 
	in step one), and then make a vertical throw from your non-dominant hand on 
	the dominant side of your body, and catch the top ball from the pair of 
	vertical throws.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/penmanspandemoniumthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To run the full Penman&#39;s 
	Pandemonium, simply bring your non-dominant hand, which made the last 
	vertical throw in the previous step, up above your dominant hand and make 
	another pair of vertical throws, beginning a second cycle.</p>
