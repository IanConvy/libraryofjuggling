	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karas&#39;s Box is a difficult 
	variation of the Box presumably established by
	<a href="http://www.michaelkaras.net/">Michael Karas</a> in which the 
	horizontal pass is made to the same hand that threw it, and then passed back 
	across the body in a similar manner. This contrasts with the Bizarre Box 
	(which is a necessary prerequisite for Karas&#39;s Box), where you make only one 
	&quot;pass&quot;, and then carry the ball back to the other side of your body. This 
	trick is one of the most difficult Box variations, since the &quot;passes&quot; 
	require accuracy and careful timing to work effectively.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn Karas&#39;s Box, start with one ball in your 
	non-dominant hand. Cross your non-dominant hand underneath your dominant 
	hand, and then make a very low throw from your non-dominant hand toward the 
	non-dominant side of your body. Right after you make this throw, uncross 
	your hands, catching the thrown ball in your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/karasboxone2.gif" width="381" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To add in the second ball, start 
	with one ball in each hand. Cross your non-dominant hand underneath your 
	dominant hand, and then simultaneously make a vertical throw from your 
	dominant hand and a &quot;pass&quot; from your non-dominant hand like the one made in 
	the previous step. Catch the &quot;pass&quot; in your non-dominant hand, and then make 
	an actual horizontal pass to your dominant hand, clearing space for your 
	non-dominant hand to catch the vertical ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/karasboxtwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this throw combination on both sides. It will likely 
	feel very awkward at first, since your hands will naturally want to make 
	throws of roughly equal height. However, with practice the throws should 
	become second nature. Before you can add in the third ball, there is one 
	more two ball exercise to learn. Start with two balls in your non-dominant 
	hand, and then cross your non-dominant hand underneath your dominant hand. 
	Make a vertical throw from your non-dominant hand and then, as that ball 
	begins to descend, make the &quot;pass&quot; that you did in step one, uncrossing your 
	hands and catching the vertical ball with your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/karasboxtwo2.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this throw combination on both sides. To 
	finally add in the third ball, start with two balls in your non-dominant 
	hand and one ball in your dominant. Cross your non-dominant hand underneath 
	your dominant hand, and then make a vertical throw from your non-dominant 
	hand. As that ball reaches its peak and begins to descend, make a vertical 
	throw from your dominant hand while simultaneously making a &quot;pass&quot; from your 
	non-dominant hand to itself. Your hands should now be uncrossed at this 
	point, with your dominant hand catching the first vertical ball. The second 
	vertical ball should now be descending toward your non-dominant hand, which 
	will make a horizontal pass to your dominant hand to clear space for a 
	catch.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To create a full cycle 
	of Karas&#39;s Box, you are going to insert the previous step into a cycle of 
	the Bizarre Box. Start by juggling the regular Box, and then transition into 
	the Bizarre Box by making a &quot;pass&quot; from an uncrossed position into a 
	crossed-arm position. In the Bizarre Box, you would then carry the passed 
	ball back around as you uncrossed your arms. In Karas&#39;s Box, you are going 
	to make another &quot;pass&quot; back across your body, while also doing a vertical 
	throw from your other hand. You will then resume juggling the regular Box.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice doing one complete cycle on each side. To run the 
	full Karas&#39;s Box, simply a single normal vertical throw/horizontal pass 
	combination (like you would do in the regular Box) after each cycle. This 
	will set you up to do another cycle using the opposite hand configuration. 
	Karas&#39;s Box is not an easy pattern, so expect to spend a lot of time 
	mastering the trick. </p>
