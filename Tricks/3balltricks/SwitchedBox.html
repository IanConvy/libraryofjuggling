	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Switched Box is a shape 
	distortion of the Box pattern in which each column is caught and thrown by 
	the opposite hand (i.e. the left column is caught by your right hand and the right 
	column is caught by your left hand). This makes for a more awkward trick as 
	both hands must quickly move side-to-side to accommodate the catches. In 
	general however the Switched Box is only slightly more difficult to perform 
	than the normal Box, and most jugglers will pick it up fairly easily.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Switched Box, start with two balls in 
	your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Make a vertical throw 
	from your dominant hand and then shift your dominant hand over to the 
	non-dominant side of your body. When the first ball reaches its peak and 
	begins to descend you are going to make a second vertical throw from your 
	dominant hand (this time on the non-dominant side of your body) and then 
	simultaneously shift both hands to the dominant side of your body while 
	making a horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand to your dominant hand. 
	This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the first vertical 
	ball. The second vertical ball will be caught by your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/switchedboxthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides until you can perform it smoothly 
	and without collisions. To run the full pattern simply make another vertical 
	throw from your dominant hand and horizontal pass from your non-dominant 
	hand as the second vertical ball begins to descend. </p>
