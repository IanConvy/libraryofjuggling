	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Underarm Shower is a 
	variation of the Shower pattern in which the high throws are made 
	under-the-arm (as the name implies). This creates a very distorted and 
	lopsided trick in which the high throw becomes nearly vertical and the 
	horizontal pass is directed away from its receiving hand. This makes the 
	pattern awkward to juggle, while also providing an interesting aesthetic.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Underarm Shower, start with one ball in each 
	hand. Position your non-dominant hand at the center of your body, and then 
	cross your dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand. Make a high 
	throw from your dominant hand toward the center of your body while 
	simultaneously passing the ball in your non-dominant hand toward the 
	dominant side of your body. Quickly uncross your dominant hand and catch the 
	passed ball. The high throw will then be caught by your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/underarmshowertwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until the throw/pass combination becomes second 
	nature. To add in the third ball, start with two balls in your dominant hand 
	and one ball in your non-dominant. Position your non-dominant hand in the 
	center and cross your dominant hand underneath (as done in the previous 
	step), then make a high throw from your dominant hand. As that ball peaks 
	and begins to descend, make a second high throw from your dominant hand 
	paired with a horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand (as done in the 
	previous step). Catch the first high throw with your non-dominant hand, and 
	then catch the second one.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until you can make all three throws 
	comfortably. To run the full Underarm Shower, simply make another throw/pass 
	combination after the second high throw, and then repeat the cycle. The 
	Underarm Shower will take some time to get used to, but the pattern itself 
	is fairly easy. </p>
