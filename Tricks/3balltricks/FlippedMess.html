	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Flipped Mess is a variation 
	of Mills Mess in which the ball at the front of the pattern, the one that is 
	normally both thrown and caught <em>over</em>-the-arm, is instead thrown and 
	caught <em>under</em>-the-arm. This leads to an awkward Mills Mess pattern 
	in which the third ball, normally thrown under-the-arm, is instead thrown 
	over-the-arm, meaning that the throw positions of the first and third ball 
	have been swapped, hence the name Flipped Mess.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Flipped Mess, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your dominant hand 
	over your non-dominant hand (this is the same configuration you would start in 
	for the regular Mills Mess), and then make a throw from your dominant hand 
	back toward the dominant side your body. You will then make a throw from 
	your non-dominant hand (still crossed underneath your dominant hand) from 
	the center of your body toward the dominant side of your body, clearing 
	space for the hand to catch the first ball. Finally, you are going to make a 
	throw from your dominant hand toward the center of your body, and then catch 
	the second ball with your now empty dominant hand. The third ball will be 
	caught by your non-dominant hand, which should uncross before catching.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/flippedmessthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. Notice again that when 
	catching the final throw your non-dominant hand uncrosses. To connect both 
	sides of the pattern together, you are going to make an under-the-arm throw 
	from your non-dominant hand before it uncrosses to catch the other ball. The 
	hand will then recross <em>over</em> your dominant hand. This position will 
	set you up to repeat the process on the opposite side of your body, with 
	your dominant hand making an under-the-arm throw and catching the ball 
	thrown from your non-dominant hand. Your non-dominant hand will then make a 
	final throw toward the non-dominant side of your body, catching the 
	under-the-arm throw made by your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/flippedmessfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have just completed one full cycle of the Flipped Mess. 
	To run the pattern continuously, make an under-the-arm throw before 
	uncrossing your dominant hand and then simply do another cycle. If you are 
	already skilled at performing Mills Mess, the Flipped Mess will likely just 
	&quot;click&quot; after you practice a cycle or two. Your mind will naturally grasp 
	the shape and rhythm of the pattern and it will therefore be easy to learn. </p>
