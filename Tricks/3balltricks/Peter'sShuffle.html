	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter&#39;s Shuffle is a variation 
	of the Boston Shuffle that I found on the
	<a href="http://www.twjc.co.uk/index.html">TWJC website</a> in which an 
	orbit is performed before making each Slam throw. This accelerates the pace 
	of the pattern, while also making it more dynamic. This tutorial will assume 
	you already know the basic Boston Shuffle.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn Peter&#39;s Shuffle, it is best to begin with the 
	orbit/slam combination. Start with one ball in each hand, and then bring 
	your non-dominant hand to the other side of your body while raising your 
	dominant hand as if preparing to do a Chop. Then, make a vertical throw from 
	your non-dominant hand while simultaneously performing a Chop with your 
	dominant hand. This Chop will turn into an orbit as you bring your dominant 
	hand back around and over the ball thrown from your non-dominant hand. Once 
	your dominant hand reaches its peak, make a Slam throw to your non-dominant 
	hand and claw catch the vertical ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/petersshuffletwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this extensively on both sides. It&#39;s best to keep 
	the vertical throw low, since that allows you to make a smaller, cleaner, 
	orbit. To add in the third ball, start by juggling a normal Cascade. Then, 
	make a vertical under-the-arm throw with your non-dominant hand, while 
	simultaneously doing a Chop (like in step one). Finish up the orbit and 
	prepare to make a Slam with your dominant hand. Just before doing so, make 
	an overthrow with your non-dominant hand, as if in the Reverse Cascade. This 
	will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the Slam. After making 
	the Slam and claw catching the under-the-arm throw, resume juggling a 
	Cascade.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/petersshufflethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To run the full 
	Peter&#39;s Shuffle, simply follow up the overthrow with an under-the-arm throw 
	from your dominant hand and an orbit/slam from your non-dominant. Assuming 
	you already know the Boston Shuffle, this continuation should come 
	naturally. </p>
