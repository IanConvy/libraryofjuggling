	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The High-Low Shower is a 
	variation of the Shower that can be best conceptualized as a small Shower 
	pattern being juggled underneath a much larger one. This requires a decent 
	amount of speed and accuracy, but the most difficult part is learning to 
	make very small throws right after making large ones (you will naturally 
	want to make successive throws at the same height). That being said the 
	High-Low Shower is still a fairly easy pattern overall, and is quite fun to 
	juggle.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the High-Low Shower start with two balls in 
	your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Make a very high throw 
	from your dominant hand toward your non-dominant hand and then quickly 
	follow it up with a lower throw in the same direction followed by a horizontal 
	pass from your non-dominant hand. The lower throw should be significantly 
	smaller than a normal Shower throw. Catch both 
	the high and low throws in your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/high-lowshowerthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until you can accurately perform both the high 
	and low throws. To run the full pattern simply make another high throw—this 
	time with a corresponding horizontal pass—before catching the previous high throw, and 
	then make another low throw and repeat the cycle. The High-Low Shower can be 
	an intimidating pattern for beginners, but learning to quickly make 
	throws of widely different heights is very useful for future tricks.</p>
