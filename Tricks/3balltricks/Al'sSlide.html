	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al&#39;s Slide is a three ball 
	pattern established by
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Idiosensory?feature=watch">Idiosensory</a> 
	that bares some resemblance to Columns, except that one of the balls in the 
	synchronous pair is caught at its peak, while the other is allowed to 
	descend. A third ball is then thrown underneath the synchronous balls in a 
	Cascade-like manner. When performed properly, Al&#39;s Slide is a fairly 
	graceful pattern, with the midair catch flowing naturally from the throwing 
	motion preceding it.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Al&#39;s Slide, start with one ball in each 
	hand. Position your hands so that your dominant hand is at the outside of 
	your body, while your non-dominant hand is roughly at the center. 
	Simultaneously make a throw from each hand such that the balls travel across 
	your body toward the opposite side. Now comes the tricky part. As you make 
	the throws, continue the motion of your dominant hand such that it follows 
	the ball thrown from the center by your non-dominant hand. Once that ball 
	reaches its peak, catch it (but do not claw catch it<em>)</em>, and then 
	lower your dominant hand and bring it back to the dominant side of your 
	body. As your dominant hand is being lowered, you are going to catch the 
	ball originally thrown by your dominant hand with your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alsslidetwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the third 
	ball, start with two balls in your non-dominant hand and one ball in your 
	dominant hand. Make the two simultaneous throws and then use your dominant 
	hand to catch the outside ball at its peak (this is all from step one). As 
	the other ball begins to descend toward your non-dominant hand, make a 
	Cascade throw from the center of your body using your non-dominant hand. 
	This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the other ball. By 
	this point your dominant hand should be returning to its original position 
	along the dominant side of your body, where it will catch the third ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alsslidethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. You have just 
	completed one full cycle of Al&#39;s Slide. Intuitively, you might be able to 
	easily figure out how the cycles connect together, in which case you are 
	finished with this tutorial. If you can&#39;t however, here is one more step to 
	practice. Start by juggling the same throws shown above, but instead of 
	simply catching the last ball with your dominant hand (which previously had 
	caught the outside synchronous ball midair), you are going to make a second 
	set of synchronous throws, with your dominant hand now in the center and 
	your non-dominant hand on the outside (the opposite configuration from when 
	they started). Catch the balls with whatever hand feels most comfortable, 
	since it is only the throws that are significant in this case.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alsslidefull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this on both sides as shown in the 
	animation. Notice that the second pair of synchronous throws sets you up for 
	a new cycle of the pattern on the opposite side if your body. To run the 
	full Al&#39;s Slide, simply perform a midair catch on the outside ball and then 
	make another Cascade throw with your other hand. By this point you should 
	begin recognizing the pattern and be able to continue it from memory. Al&#39;s 
	Slide is a fairly simple pattern, but will take some practice to make smooth 
	and graceful. </p>
