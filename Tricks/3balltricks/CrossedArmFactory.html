	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Crossed-Arm Factory is a 
	variation of the three ball Factory pattern in which the carried ball is 
	dropped and caught by the same hand, resulting in a crossed-arm position at 
	the end of each cycle. The trick is more dynamic and complex than the 
	regular Factory, making for a more impressive pattern, though this is offset 
	by a greater overall difficulty.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To being learning the Crossed-Arm Factory, start with one 
	ball in each hand. Cross your dominant hand over your non-dominant hand and 
	then raise your dominant hand vertically so it is around chin-level.&nbsp; 
	Drop the ball in your dominant hand and then quickly swing than hand around 
	and under your non-dominant hand, catching the dropped ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmfactorytwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the third 
	ball, start with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your 
	non-dominant. Make a vertical throw along the center of your body from your 
	dominant hand, and then follow it up with a second vertical throw from your 
	dominant hand along the outside of your body on the dominant side. This will 
	clear space for your dominant hand to catch the center ball it threw. As 
	that second ball is thrown, you are going to take the ball in your 
	non-dominant hand and raise it up vertically in the air such that it remains 
	horizontally aligned with the thrown ball. As that thrown ball reaches its 
	peak and begins to descend, you are going to cross your dominant hand over 
	to the non-dominant side of your body and make a mostly vertical throw. This 
	will clear space for your dominant hand to catch the ball descending along 
	the outside of your body. While this is going on, you are also going to take 
	your non-dominant hand, which should have followed the outside ball to its 
	peak, and move it horizontally to the dominant side of your body. So far 
	this has all been identical to the regular Factory.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To recap, your dominant hand has crossed over to the 
	non-dominant side of your body and made a throw, while your non-dominant 
	hand has been raised in the air and crossed over to the dominant side of 
	your body. As the ball thrown from your dominant hand reaches its peak and 
	begins to descend, you are going to drop the ball in your non-dominant hand. 
	The ball that was dropped and the ball that was thrown should now be 
	descending alongside each other. After making the drop you will swing your 
	non-dominant hand around and under your dominant hand, catching the dropped 
	ball (as was done in step one). At the same time your dominant hand will 
	make a vertical throw along the center of your body, clearing space for it 
	to catch the ball it threw. This catch and the catching of the dropped ball 
	should happen at the same time. The center ball will then be caught by your 
	non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="440" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmfactorythree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. For the final step, 
	you are going to uncross your arms after the simultaneous catches at the end 
	of previous step are made. As the center ball descends you will make a 
	vertical throw from your non-dominant hand along the non-dominant side of 
	your body, clearing space for that hand to catch the center ball. The 
	outside ball will then also be caught by your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmfactoryfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this on both sides. Notice how the last 
	two throws (the center and outside vertical throws) of the previous step are 
	mirror images of the first two throws. To perform the full trick, simply 
	raise the ball in your dominant hand up so that it remains horizontally 
	aligned with the outside ball thrown from your non-dominant hand, and then 
	repeat the the same throws and catches of the previous step with your hands 
	reversed. The Crossed-Arm Factory, because of its odd ball drop, will take 
	some time to perfect, though the core pattern itself is fairly easy to 
	figure out. </p>
