	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Crossed-Arm Shower is, as 
	its name suggests, a variation of the Shower pattern in which your arms are 
	crossed. The overall shape of the pattern is virtually unchanged (though 
	usually smaller), so conceptually the trick is fairly simple. The main 
	difficulty comes from learning how to make horizontal passes from a 
	crossed-arm position—a very unusual throw type not present in most juggling 
	tricks. The hand that throws these passes can be crossed over or 
	under, but for this tutorial I am going to consider the crossed-over form as 
	standard, and the crossed-under form as the &quot;Reverse Variation.&quot;<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Crossed-Arm Shower, start with one ball 
	in your dominant hand and then cross your arms such that your dominant arm 
	is on top. Without uncrossing your arms, make a horizontal pass from your 
	dominant hand to your non-dominant hand. You will want to make this a 
	forceful throw along a straight line—the ball should not be lightly tossed, 
	as might be your first instinct.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmshowerone.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until the throw feels natural. Unlike in the 
	animation, you could also practice passing the ball back from the hand 
	crossed under, as it is the quickest way to return the ball to your dominant 
	hand. To add in the second ball, you are going to start with one ball in 
	each hand and your arms crossed in the same configuration as before. You 
	will then perform an under-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand toward 
	your dominant hand while simultaneously making a horizontal pass from your 
	dominant hand to your non-dominant hand (as was practiced in the first 
	step), catching the under-the-arm throw with your now empty dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmshowertwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this extensively. Next, we are going to extend the 
	second step such that, after making its first under-the-arm throw, your 
	non-dominant hand will make another throw using the ball passed by your 
	dominant hand. Your dominant hand will then catch the first under-the-arm 
	throw and quickly pass it back to your non-dominant hand, clearing space for 
	your dominant hand to catch the second throw.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmshowertworun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until you can do all of the throws comfortably 
	and consistently. To add in the third ball, start with two balls in your 
	non-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant hand. Cross your arms in the 
	same configuration as before, then make an under-the-arm throw from 
	your non-dominant hand. As that ball peaks and begins to descend, you will 
	make a second throw from your non-dominant hand while simultaneously passing 
	the ball in your dominant hand to your non-dominant hand. This will clear 
	space for your dominant hand to catch the first under-the-arm throw. Your 
	dominant hand will then also catch the second ball thrown from your 
	non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmshowerthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As always, practice this step until you are comfortable with 
	it. To continue the pattern, simply make another pass/under-the-arm-throw 
	combination and then keep adding them in as you become more proficient. The 
	Crossed-Arm Shower is an enjoyable pattern in its own right, but its real 
	value lies in unlocking three ball tricks that utilize a crossed-arm 
	horizontal pass (e.g. non-standard versions of the 441 and 531 Mills Mess). </p>
