	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Orinoco Flow is essentially 
	an extended version of the Weave, in which one ball is carried through a 
	two-in-one pattern twice in opposite directions. This longer arm flourish 
	requires an extra throw to be made, bringing the Orinoco Flow out of 
	familiar 423-variation territory. That being said it is still important for 
	you be very comfortable with the Weave before attempting this trick.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Orinoco Flow, start with two 
	balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Shift 
	your non-dominant hand such that it is positioned directly above your 
	dominant hand, and then with your dominant hand make a throw from the center 
	of your body to the dominant side of your body (as if doing a regular two in 
	one pattern). At the same time you will swing your non-dominant hand around 
	in a half-circle such that it passes outside of and then under the ball your 
	dominant hand just threw. As that ball peaks and begins to descend you will 
	make a roughly identical throw from your dominant hand, clearing space for 
	your dominant hand to catch the first ball. As this second throw is being 
	made your non-dominant hand should have completed its half-circle and ended 
	up at about the center of your body. You will then swing your non-dominant 
	hand back around and under the second ball, such that your non-dominant hand 
	ends up crossed over your dominant hand. You will then catch the second ball 
	in your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/orinocoflowthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. For the next step you are going 
	to make a crossing throw from your dominant hand to the non-dominant side of 
	your body before catching the second ball. At the same time you will uncross 
	your non-dominant hand in a large circle such that it passes outside of the 
	descending second ball&nbsp; and then over and around the freshly thrown 
	third ball, coming to a stop on the non-dominant side of your body. You will 
	then make a throw with your non-dominant hand from the center of your body 
	to the non-dominant side of your body (as if juggling a two in one pattern), 
	clearing space for you to catch the crossing throw made by your dominant 
	hand. Your non-dominant hand will then catch the ball it threw.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="451" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/orinocoflowfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. Notice how the last 
	throw is basically a mirror image of the the first throw; to juggle the full 
	pattern simply repeat the arm flourish and accompanying throws, this time 
	with the opposite hands. The Orinoco Flow is only difficult insomuch as it 
	can take some time to figure out the arm motionsâ€”after that it is about as 
	hard as the Weave. </p>
