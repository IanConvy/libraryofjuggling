	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Inverted Box is a variation 
	of the standard three ball Box in which the horizontal pass is made above 
	the two other balls, instead of underneath them. This creates a fast-paced 
	pattern in which accurate throws are a necessity. Before learning the 
	Inverted Box, it is important for you to be already comfortable with the 
	N-Box and Luke&#39;s Shuffle, since this trick combines aspects of both 
	patterns.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Inverted Box, start with one ball in 
	each hand. Raise your non-dominant hand about a foot above your dominant 
	hand, and then make a near-horizontal throw from your non-dominant hand in 
	the direction of your dominant hand. Simultaneously, throw the ball in your 
	dominant hand vertically such that the first ball will pass over it. Now 
	that your dominant hand is empty, you can raise it up to catch the first 
	ball. Immediately after you have caught it, throw it, at the same height, 
	back to your non-dominant hand, clearing space for you to catch the second 
	ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/invertedboxtwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this <strong>extensively </strong>on both sides, 
	making sure that the vertical throw peaks at a height significantly lower 
	than the height of the horizontal pass. Once you have this step mastered, 
	you are ready to add in the third ball. Start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a vertical throw from 
	your dominant hand while simultaneously raising that hand up to make a 
	horizontal pass. As you perform the pass, make a second vertical throw, this 
	time from your non-dominant hand, and catch the passed ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/invertedboxthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have this step mastered on both sides, you can attempt to 
	juggle the full Inverted Box by simply making another horizontal pass going 
	back to your dominant hand, and then adding in more throws as you become 
	more comfortable with the pattern. This trick is not easy, and will take a 
	lot of practice to master. </p>
