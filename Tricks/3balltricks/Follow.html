	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Follow is a three ball 
	pattern in which one ball is carried behind another, duplicating its arc, 
	and then switches positions for the next cycle. This trick is one of the 
	many 423 variations and as such it&#39;s a fairly easy pattern to learn, though 
	the carry might take some practice.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Follow, start with one ball in each 
	hand. Cross your non-dominant hand over to the dominant side of your body 
	and position it right above your dominant hand. Make a throw from your 
	non-dominant hand back toward the non-dominant side of your body and then, 
	as you are making this throw, begin following the thrown ball with the ball 
	in your dominant hand, continuing as the thrown ball peaks and begins to 
	descend. Catch the thrown ball with your non-dominant hand, making sure to 
	follow its descent with your dominant hand; the held ball should end up 
	positioned right above the caught ball, similar to the way you started (with 
	hands reversed).<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/followtwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. You will want to be 
	comfortable enough such that you can switch directions quickly and smoothly. 
	To add in the third ball, start with two balls in your non-dominant hand and 
	one ball in your dominant hand. Position your non-dominant hand above your 
	dominant hand and then throw a ball from your non-dominant hand back toward 
	the non-dominant side of your body. Follow this ball with your dominant 
	hand, just like you practiced in the first step. As the thrown ball descends 
	you are going to throw the other ball in your non-dominant hand as an 
	under-the-arm throw, crossing it over to the dominant side of your body 
	beforehand. This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the 
	first ball it threw (the one being followed). You will then throw the ball 
	in your dominant hand—which should have finished its carry and now be 
	positioned above your non-dominant hand—back over to the dominant side of 
	your body and catch the under-the-arm throw with your now empty dominant 
	hand. Your dominant hand will then catch the last ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/followthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this on both sides. Notice how the last 
	throw is basically a mirror image of the first throw—to continue juggling 
	the pattern simply follow that last ball with your non-dominant hand and do 
	the under-the-arm throw with your dominant hand, repeating the cycle with 
	hands reversed. The Follow is an easy but fairly unique three ball trick, 
	which is a great combination for beginners. </p>
