	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rainbow Cross (also known as 
	The Umbrella) is a variation on the standard Columns pattern in which the 
	two outside balls are thrown in arching paths across your body, with one 
	ball passing just beneath the other to avoid collisions.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only tricky part of this pattern is the arch throws, 
	which require a bit of practice to master. Therefore, to most quickly learn 
	the trick, it would be best to start out with just two balls, and practice 
	those throws.<img alt=""  height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/rainbowarchestwo.gif" width="400" class="smallanim" /><br />
&nbsp; Once you can make the arch throws easily, you can add in the third 
	ball. It is probably most natural to start with a normal Columns pattern, 
	and then occasionally add in some arch throws. As you become more accustomed 
	to the trick, you can eventually start doing Rainbow Cross constantly.&nbsp; </p>
