	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shuffler&#39;s Mess is a three ball 
	pattern established by
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCihS_nPuybkG0jKQJf8l3nA">
	Idiosensory</a>. It is basically a 53133 siteswap thrown in such a way that 
	it resembles Mills Mess, with the extra two &quot;3&quot; throws providing most of the 
	added complexity to an otherwise fairly normal looking 531 pattern. Before 
	attempting Shuffler&#39;s Mess it is important that you already be comfortable 
	with both the 531 and Mill Mess, and experience with the combined 531 Mills 
	Mess couldn&#39;t hurt either.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Shuffler&#39;s Mess, start with two balls in 
	your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Make a vertical 
	throw from your dominant hand and then, as that ball descends, make a 
	roughly vertical high throw along the outside of the descending ball, 
	catching that ball with your now empty dominant hand. The high throw is the 
	&quot;5&quot; throw of the 531, so you will then follow it up with the corresponding 
	&quot;3&quot; and &quot;1&quot; throws from your non-dominant hand and dominant hand 
	respectively, eventually catching the &quot;5&quot; throw under-the-arm with your 
	non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/shufflersmessthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. For the next step, 
	start by performing the same throws and catches you made in step one, except 
	before making the final under-the-arm catch of the &quot;5&quot; throw you are going 
	to make a vertical under-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand along the 
	outside of the descending &quot;5&quot; ball, catching that ball in your now empty 
	non-dominant hand. As the ball you just threw reaches its peak you are going 
	to make a throw with your dominant hand from the non-dominant side of your 
	body (your dominant hand will be crossed over your non-dominant arm) toward 
	the center of your body. You will then uncross your now empty dominant hand 
	and catch the under-the-arm vertical ball your non-dominant hand threw. The 
	last ball will then be caught by your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/shufflersmessfull.gif" width="420" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this on both sides as shown above. 
	Notice how the last throw is basically a shorter mirrored version of the 
	first throw. To run the full pattern simply make another &quot;5&quot; throw, this 
	time from your non-dominant hand, along the outside of the other ball and 
	then simply repeat the same throws you already performed with your hands 
	switched. Shuffler&#39;s Mess is not a very difficult pattern, but you may 
	experience some unconscious interference between this trick and the normal 
	531, as the throw positions and subsequent catches are very similar yet 
	still somewhat different. </p>
