	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flo&#39;s Mess is a variation of 
	the standard Mills Mess in which one of the balls is carried from the middle 
	of the pattern to the outside, creating a Windmill-like effect that 
	alternates sides. Visually, Flo&#39;s Mess appears only subtly different from 
	Mills Mess, so spectators may not be that impressed when you switch between 
	them.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn Flo&#39;s Mess, start by juggling a regular Mills Mess 
	pattern. Then, during one of the cycles, you are going to make an overthrow 
	from the hand holding the third ball (the one thrown last during a cycle) 
	and grab the middle ball. From you other hand, throw the ball that used to 
	be first in the cycle (it will now be second) under the arm of the hand that 
	caught the middle such that it follow the same path as the first overthrow. 
	Finally, make another overthrow with the middle ball you caught earlier.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/flosmessthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. The full Flo&#39;s Mess consists of 
	repeating cycles of these three throws made on alternating sides, so in the 
	final step you will chain two of these cycles together. Start by juggling a 
	regular Mills Mess, then transition into the three throws made in step one. 
	After making the last throw, your are going to repeat each of the three 
	throws on the other side of your body, using the same ball that was used in 
	the previous cycle. The first throw will be an overthrow, followed by an 
	under the arm throw, followed by another overthrow.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/flosmessfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To run the full Flo&#39;s Mess, just keep repeating the cycle on 
	each side (the final throw in the animation above shows the beginning of a 
	third cycle). When done correctly, the trick should feel like a Windmill 
	that alternates sides after a couple of throws.</p>
