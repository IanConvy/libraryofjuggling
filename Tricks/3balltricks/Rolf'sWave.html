	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rolf&#39;s Wave is a three ball 
	pattern that may be best described as a gutted Kingston Shuffle; the 
	multiplex has been removed, and there are no ball carries. However, the 
	&quot;fake&quot; throw (a throw made and then quickly caught by the same hand) at the 
	beginning and the claw-catch at the end are both retained. This makes for an 
	easier pattern overall, so the Kingston Shuffle is not a necessary 
	prerequisite.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Rolf&#39;s Wave, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Make a throw from your 
	non-dominant hand toward the dominant side of your body, then reach over and 
	claw-catch it with the same hand. As this catch is being made, you are going 
	to cross your dominant hand over to the non-dominant side of your body and 
	then perform an under-the-arm vertical throw. You will then drop the ball in 
	your non-dominant hand (the ball it just threw and caught) and claw-catch 
	the vertical ball just thrown by your dominant hand. Your dominant hand will 
	then catch the ball your non-dominant hand just dropped.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/rolfswavethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. For the next step, you are going 
	to make a throw from your dominant hand after your non-dominant hand drops 
	its ball. You will make this throw from the center of your body, and it will 
	be aimed toward your non-dominant shoulder. Your now-empty dominant hand 
	will then catch the ball dropped by your non-dominant hand, while your 
	non-dominant hand (having just claw-caught a ball) will claw-catch the ball 
	just thrown from your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/rolfswavefull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. You have just 
	completed one cycle of Rolf&#39;s Wave. To begin a new cycle on the other side 
	of your body, simply make another fake throw (this time with your dominant 
	hand) and then repeat the same throws and catches with your hands reversed. 
	Rolf&#39;&#39;s Wave is not the most visually striking pattern, but it can serve as 
	a good foundation for more complex variations. </p>
