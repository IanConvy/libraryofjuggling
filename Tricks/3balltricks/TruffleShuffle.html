	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Truffle Shuffle is an 
	asymmetrical three ball pattern in which one hand alternates between making 
	lofty fountain throws and quick shuffle passes. The other hand contributes 
	very little to the trick, only making a quick pass during the shuffle. <br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step to learning the Truffle Shuffle is to practice 
	the shuffle pass. Start with one ball in each hand, and then lift your 
	dominant hand about twelve inches above your non-dominant hand. Then, your 
	are going to make simultaneous throws from each hand. The dominant hand will 
	throw diagonally downward toward your non-dominant hand, while your 
	non-dominant hand will make a roughly horizontal throw (it should be angled 
	slightly upward toward your dominant hand).<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/truffleshuffletwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice these two throws until they are second nature. To 
	add in the third ball, start with two balls in your dominant hand and one 
	ball in your non-dominant. Cross your dominant hand underneath your 
	non-dominant hand, and then make a high under-the-arm throw back towards the 
	center of your body. Then, bring your dominant hand back to its normal side, 
	raise it up diagonally above your non-dominant hand, and do the two throws 
	practiced in the previous step. Then bring your dominant hand back 
	underneath your non-dominant hand and make another high throw, marking the 
	start of a second cycle and clearing space for you to catch the first high 
	throw.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/truffleshufflethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To run the full Truffle Shuffle, just make another pair of 
	passes after the last high throw, and then repeat the cycle. The Truffle 
	Shuffle is not a particularly difficult trick, but it can have a relatively 
	quick pace so it is probably best to make very lofty throws when you are 
	first learning, in order to give you adequate time to make the passes.</p>
