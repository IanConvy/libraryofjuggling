	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reverse 441 is a variation 
	of the 441 (or Half-Box as I, probably in vain, try to call it) in which the 
	vertical throws are made toward the center of your body, instead of toward 
	the the side. This makes for a slightly more cramped and therefore more 
	difficult pattern, though the trick itself is still very basic. The Reverse 
	441 is so similar to the regular 441 (Half-Box) that a separate tutorial is 
	not necessary. Once you have learned the base pattern, the reversed 
	variation should come naturally. If for some reason it does not, you can 
	simply follow the tutorial for the regular 441 and flip the direction of all 
	vertical throws. </p>
