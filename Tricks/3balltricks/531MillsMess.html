	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 531 Mills Mess is a 
	variation of Mills Mess (or the 531 depending on your reference point) in 
	which the balls are thrown in a tower pattern while your arms cross and 
	uncross during each cycle. This adds a whole new layer of complexity and 
	movement to the otherwise rigid 531, though the pattern itself is 
	surprisingly easy to learn if your are already comfortable with the two base 
	patterns. While this pattern is the most common version of the 531 Mills 
	Mess, there are in fact two other variations of the trick: one where the 
	high throw is made with arms uncrossed, and one with the throw made from the 
	hand crossed over. However, this version, with the high throw made 
	under-the-arm, is by far the most popular.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the 531 Mills Mess, start with one ball in each 
	hand. Cross your dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand, and then 
	make a high throw toward the center of your body from your dominant hand. 
	After that ball is thrown, quickly make a low throw toward the center of 
	your body from your non-dominant hand, and then uncross your arms.&nbsp; 
	Cross your dominant hand over your non-dominant hand and catch the low ball, 
	and then catch the high ball with your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/531millsmesstwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. Now that you have 
	learned the high/low throw combination, you can move on to the high/pass 
	combination. Start with two balls in your dominant hand, and then cross your 
	dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand. Make a high throw and then 
	uncross and recross your hands such that your dominant hand is now on top. 
	Right as your hands are uncrossed, make a pass from your dominant hand to 
	your non-dominant hand, and then finish crossing your arms. Catch the high 
	throw with your non-dominant hand, which should now be on the bottom.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/531millsmesstwo2.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. The only combination 
	you haven&#39;t practiced yet is the low/pass, so this will be the final two 
	ball exercise. Start with one ball in each hand, and then, like before, 
	cross your dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand. Make a low throw 
	from your non-dominant hand toward the center of your body, and then uncross 
	and recross your hands in the opposite configuration (just like you did in 
	the previous step). At the moment your hands are uncrossed, make a 
	horizontal pass from your dominant hand to your non-dominant hand. Finish 
	recrossing your hands and catch the low throw with your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/531millsmesstwo3.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this on both sides. Now that you have 
	every throw combination mastered, you can finally put them all together. 
	Start with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your 
	non-dominant. Cross your dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand, 
	and then make a high throw from your dominant hand. Shortly after that ball 
	leaves your hand, make a low throw from your non-dominant hand and uncross 
	your arms. Once they are uncrossed, make a horizontal pass from your 
	dominant hand to your non-dominant hand, and then cross your dominant hand 
	over your non-dominant hand, catching the low ball with your dominant hand 
	in the process. At this point the high throw should be approaching your 
	non-dominant hand, with which you will catch the ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/531millsmessthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice these three throws on both sides. To run 
	the full 531 Mills Mess, simply make another high throw using the ball 
	passed to your non-dominant hand. This will clear space for your 
	non-dominant hand to catch the high ball from the previous cycle, which will 
	then be used to make a horizontal pass back to your dominant hand. The 531 
	Mills Mess is not a particularly hard trick, though it is one of the more 
	difficult three ball Mills Mess variations.</p>
