	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Established by well-known juggler Steven 
	Mills, Mills Mess is one of the most famous 3-ball tricks. It involves a 
	side-to-side movement of the props, with each one thrown over the other in a 
	never ending flow. Despite the much higher complexity of the trick, 
	Mills Mess has the same siteswap as a basic Cascade, with the crossing 
	motion of your arms 
	creating an extra flare that audiences love.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	To learn Mills Mess, it helps to break the trick down 
	into smaller pieces. Starting with one ball in your dominant hand, cross 
	that arm over the other, and throw the ball across your body to your 
	non-dominant hand. At the same time, uncross and recross your arms, this 
	time with your non-dominant arm on top, and catch the ball with your 
	non-dominant hand.<img alt=""  height="165" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/millsmess1ball.gif" width="165" class="smallanim" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have just learned the pattern for the first 
	ball of Mills Mess. 
	Practice until you are very comfortable leading with either hand, since you 
	must be able to perform the throw while managing two other balls. <br />
	<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second ball starts out in your non-dominant hand, and is 
	thrown as your arms are uncrossingâ€”specifically the point at which your two 
	arms are level with each other. The ball is then caught with your dominant 
	hand, now underneath your non-dominant arm.<br />
	<img alt=""  height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/millsmess1ball2.gif" width="400" class="smallanim" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As before, practice this extensively on both sides. You 
	should now be ready to combine the first two steps. Start with one ball in 
	each hand, arms crossed. Throw the first ball as you uncross your arms, and 
	then throw the second ball in the same direction once your arms are level. 
	Then, recross your arms in the opposite configuration and catch the first 
	ball in your non-dominant hand, and the second ball in your dominant hand.<br />
	<br />&nbsp;<img alt=""  height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/millsmess2ball.gif" width="400" class="smallanim" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this until it is second nature. To 
	complete the Mills Mess pattern, we now have to add the third ball. This is 
	likely to be the most difficult step, not because the third ball&#39;s path is 
	difficult, but because you now have to deal with three balls simultaneously. 
	The third ball is thrown last, out of your dominant hand. It is caught by 
	the hand that throws the first ball of the next cycle. <br /><br />

	It is best to start out practicing one cycle at a time, while making sure 
	that all of your throws are clean and accurate. Only then should you try 
	chaining multiple cycles together. Make sure to maintain the flow of the 
	balls from left to right, since it is easy to decay into messy, vertical 
	column throws. The Mills Mess pattern itself is not restricted to three 
	balls, and can in fact be juggled with four, five, and even six balls, in 
	addition to other prop types like clubs and rings.</p>
