	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pendulum Drop is a three 
	ball pattern in which one hand juggles a Two in one while the other hand 
	rhythmically catches and drops a third ball. When done properly, that hand 
	will move back and forth in a manner reminiscent of a pendulum. The Pendulum 
	Drop is one of three main tricks that use a consitent horizontal carry (the 
	other two being the Factory and Inverted Shower).<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Pendulum Drop, start by juggling a Two in one 
	with your dominant hand while holding a third ball in your non-dominant 
	hand. Raise your non-dominant hand such that it is at the same height as the 
	peak of your Two in one, and then make a small throw from your non-dominant 
	hand toward your dominant hand (you are pretty much dropping the ball down 
	to your other hand). At the same time, make a throw from your dominant hand 
	toward the center of your body, so that it peaks near your non-dominant 
	hand. Catch that ball with your non-dominant hand, and then continue 
	juggling a Two in one with your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/pendulumdropthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until your are comfortable making the pass from 
	your non-dominant hand. To run the full pattern, you are going to make a 
	pass after every two throws from your dominant hand (i.e. every other 
	throw). When your non-dominant hand is not making a pass, you are going to 
	swing it away for the center of your body, a position which it will then 
	swing back from when making another throw (this creates the pendulum 
	effect). A fair amount of practice will likely be required to achieve 
	maximum smoothness and rhythm. </p>
