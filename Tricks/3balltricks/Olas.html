	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olas is a rare but impressive 
	trick established by <span><a href="http://www.olalofberg.se/aqua/fintro.html">
	Ola LÃ¶fberg</a></span> that utilizes a unique revolving catch along with 
	quick multiplexes to create one of the most unique juggling patterns. Unfortunately, 
	due to its lack of mention in most juggling guides, Olas is a trick known to 
	relatively few jugglers, particularly when compared to patterns like the Mills 
	Mess and Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn Olas, it is best to break the trick down into two 
	basic components, the catch and the multiplex. The odd revolving catch of 
	Olas is best learned by starting with two balls in your non-dominant hand. 
	Throw one into the air, as if in a Cascade pattern, and then claw catch it 
	with your dominant hand. Right as that catch is made, throw the the second 
	ball, and swing you dominant hand back around and claw catch that ball as 
	well.<img alt=""  height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/olastwo.gif" width="400" class="smallanim" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this catch until it is 
	second nature with both hands. The second part of Olas is the multiplex 
	throw, which may take some practice to master. If you aren&#39;t already 
	familiar with a multiplex throw, it is a throw in which you release two 
	balls simultaneously. In this case, one ball will be passed straight into 
	the other hand, while the second ball will be thrown to the other side as if 
	in a normal Cascade. Before any of this happens, you will also be making a 
	normal cascade throw with a ball in the other hand, which will travel over 
	the two multiplexed balls.<img alt=""  height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/olasmulti.gif" width="400" class="smallanim" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, practice this portion until you can perform it 
	smoothly and consistently. Now that you have learned both components, it is 
	time to put them together. Start by juggling a regular Cascade (this is the 
	easiest way to transition into Olas), and then make a claw catch on one of 
	the balls using your dominant and then do a revolving catch of the next 
	ball. You should now have two balls in you dominant hand, and one ball in 
	the other. Throw that ball out of your non-dominant hand as if in a Cascade, 
	and then perform a multiplex with the two balls in your dominant hand, just 
	like in the animation above. Resume a normal Cascade afterward.<img alt=""  height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/olasrun.gif" width="400" class="smallanim" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have mastered this pattern on both sides (as shown 
	in the animation), it is only a matter of removing the extra Cascade throws 
	in the middle, and you are juggling Olas. Instead of returning to a Cascade 
	after the multiplex, you are instead going to toss the passed ball back 
	across your body, and then claw catch the more lofty multiplex throw. Using 
	a revolving catch, you are going to then grab the ball thrown from your 
	other hand, and then multiplex again out of that end, repeating the pattern 
	on the other side of your body. If you are having a hard time visualizing 
	the continuation, watch the animation below closely, 
	paying particular attention to what happens after the multiplex throw (the 
	balls are colored for added clarity).<img alt=""  height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/olasslow.gif" width="400" class="smallanim" />&nbsp; </p>
