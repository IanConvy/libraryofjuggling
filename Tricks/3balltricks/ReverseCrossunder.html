	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reverse Crossunder is, as 
	it sounds, a time reversed variation of the Crossunder. Instead of crossing 
	your arms to throw the balls, you cross your arms to catch them. That&#39;s 
	basically all there is to it. Before attempting the Reverse Crossunder it 
	is important that you already be very comfortable juggling the Columns pattern 
	with either hand catching the middle ball. You do not need to already know the Crossunder 
	pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Reverse Crossunder, start with one ball 
	in each hand. Simultaneously make a vertical throw from each hand and then, 
	as the balls peak and begin to descend, cross your arms and catch each ball 
	with the hand that didn&#39;t throw it.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/reversecrossundertwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this using both arm configurations. To add in the 
	third ball, start with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your 
	non-dominant hand. Make a pair of simultaneous vertical throws and then, as 
	those balls peak and begin to descend, throw the third ball vertically along 
	the center of your body and cross your arms. Catch the two vertical balls 
	and then uncross your arms while catching the center ball with the hand 
	that was crossed<em> under </em>your other hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/reversecrossunderthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. You have just completed one full 
	cycle of the Reverse Crossunder. To run the full pattern, just make another 
	pair of vertical throws and remember to cross your arms in the opposite 
	configuration when catching the balls. The Reverse Crossunder is, like the Crossunder, 
	a fairly easy yet fun variation of Columns that is great for beginners. </p>
