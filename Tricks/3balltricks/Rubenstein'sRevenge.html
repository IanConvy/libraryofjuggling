	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge is a three 
	ball trick established by Rick Rubenstein. Though it may not look it, 
	Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge is actually just a regular Mills Mess pattern with a 
	revolving flourish performed after the third throw of each cycle. That last 
	ball is thrown higher than the rest to accommodate the added arm movements, 
	resulting in a 52233 siteswap.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge, it is best to begin by 
	isolating the flourish. Start with two balls, one in each hand, with your 
	non-dominant arm crossed over your dominant. Then, uncross your arms, 
	tracing a circle with the two balls, and then begin to re-cross your arms, 
	throwing the ball from your non-dominant hand (now on the bottom) back 
	across your body as if in a Mills Mess. Keep circling around with your 
	dominant arm, and throw the ball in that hand behind the first ball, again 
	as if in a Mills Mess. Finally, claw catch the first ball with your dominant 
	hand, and catch the second ball with your non-dominant. You should end up 
	with your arms crossed in the opposite configuration as when you started.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/rubensteinsrevengetwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the next step we are going to add in 
	the third ball. This ball, unlike in a Mills Mess, is thrown rather 
	vertically to keep it out of the way of the flourishes. Start with two balls 
	in your dominant hand crossed underneath your non-dominant hand, which is 
	holding one ball. Throw a ball from your dominant hand vertically, and then 
	execute the flourish. After making the first throw of the flourish, you are 
	going to catch the ball you threw vertically using that hand. You are then 
	going to cross that hand underneath your dominant arm (now on top) and make 
	another vertical throw, catching the second throw of the flourish using that 
	now empty hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/rubensteinsrevengerun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this step on both sides until you are very 
	comfortable with it, and don&#39;t forget to claw catch the first ball of the 
	flourish. In order to run the full pattern, just do another flourish after 
	the last vertical throw in the step above, and continue the pattern on each 
	side. Remember, as in Mills Mess, each ball has its own unique path through 
	the pattern, so if you find that a given ball is traveling along a different 
	path each cycle, something is wrong.</p>
