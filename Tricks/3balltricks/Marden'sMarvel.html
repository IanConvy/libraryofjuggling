	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marden&#39;s Marvel is a three ball 
	pattern established by 
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/dmarden117?feature=watch">Daniel Marden</a>. It is essentially Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge 
	with an extra throw inserted during the flourish. This gives the trick an 
	aesthetic more similar to the Windmill, with its circling arm motions and 
	ball paths. If you are already very comfortable with Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge 
	then you might find this pattern very easy to grasp through simple 
	adaptation, but for this tutorial I will work from the ground up.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Marden&#39;s Marvel, start with two balls in 
	your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your arms such 
	that your dominant arm is underneath your non-dominant arm, then make a 
	vertical throw from your dominant hand. After that throw is made you will 
	begin to uncross and then recross your arms such that dominant hand is on 
	top. As your dominant hand begins recrossing (after having uncrossed), the 
	ball it previously threw should be beginning to descend. Make a throw from 
	your dominant hand after it is about halfway finished recrossing, clearing 
	space for that hand to claw catch the first ball. You will then make an 
	under-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand toward the non-dominant side 
	of your body, clearing space for it to catch the second ball thrown from 
	your dominant hand. Your dominant hand will then claw catch the ball just 
	thrown from your non-dominant hand as it reaches its peak.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/mardensmarvelthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. For the next step you are going 
	to make a throw from your dominant hand before it catches the last ball of 
	the previous step. This throw should be roughly identical to the throw your 
	dominant hand made while recrossing. You will then perform a vertical 
	under-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand along the dominant side of 
	your body, clearing space for that hand to catch the ball just thrown from 
	your dominant hand. This last throw should then be caught by your 
	non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/mardensmarvelfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. Notice that the final 
	throw of this step is a mirror image of the first throw. To run the full 
	pattern simply repeat the the same throws and catches using the opposite 
	hand configuration. Marden&#39;s Marvel is not all that difficult of a pattern, 
	but when performed with speed it can impress and confound even an 
	experienced juggler. </p>
