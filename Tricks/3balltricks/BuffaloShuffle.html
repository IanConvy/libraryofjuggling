	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buffalo Shuffle is a 
	variation of the Georgian Shuffle in which the multiplex is thrown under the 
	arm, followed by two claw catches in quick succession. This gives the 
	pattern a rushed feeling when juggled, differentiating it from the more calm 
	and rhythmic Georgian Shuffle. There is also a symmetrical version of the 
	Buffalo Shuffle known as the Davenport Shuffle.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Buffalo Shuffle, it is best to start with the 
	first two under the arm throws. Hold two balls in your dominant hand and one 
	ball in your non-dominant hand. Cross your non-dominant hand underneath your 
	dominant hand, and then make a vertical throw with your non-dominant hand. 
	Then, bring your non-dominant arm around and over your dominant arm, claw 
	catching the ball with your non-dominant hand. Just as that ball is being 
	caught, make a split multiplex with your dominant hand, and catch both 
	balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/buffaloshufflethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have mastered this step, it is time to add in the 
	last two throws. Instead of ending by simply catching the outside 
	multiplexed ball, as shown in the previous step, you are instead going to 
	make a vertical throw with your non-dominant hand, clearing space for the 
	outside multiplexed ball to be caught. Then, you are going to reach over 
	with your dominant hand and claw catch the vertical throw. Finally, you are 
	going to make an under the arm throw with your non-dominant hand, identical 
	to the one done at the beginning of the previous step. This will set you up 
	for the next cycle.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/buffaloshufflerun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#39;s one cycle of the Buffalo Shuffle. To run the full 
	pattern, just claw catch the last throw of the previous step, and do another 
	multiplex.</p>
