	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Triazzle is a three ball 
	pattern which uses a combination of Column, Cascade, and horizontal throws 
	to create a highly geometric trick. With the help of a quick underarm carry, 
	the balls form a triangle shape on each side of your body, making the 
	pattern very lopsided during any given cycle.<br />
	<br />
	To begin learning the Triazzle, start with two balls in your non-dominant hand. Make 
	a normal Cascade throw from your non-dominant hand to your dominant hand 
	followed by a second Cascade throw from the same hand. After your dominant 
	hand catches the first ball, make a vertical Column throw with it from your 
	dominant hand, clearing space for your dominant hand to catch the second 
	ball. As the Column ball begins to descend back toward your dominant hand, 
	make a Cascade throw from your dominant hand to your non-dominant hand, 
	clearing space for your dominant hand to catch the Column ball. As the 
	Cascade throw made from your dominant hand approaches your non-dominant 
	hand, make another Cascade throw from your dominant hand (using the now 
	caught Column ball). Use your non-dominant hand to catch the first ball, and 
	then make a Column throw from the same hand, clearing space for your 
	non-dominant hand to catch the second ball. Then catch the Column ball in 
	your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/triazzletwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. Notice how the step ends with a 
	vertical Column throw from your non-dominant hand. For the best practice, 
	you will want to make a Cascade throw from your non-dominant hand back to 
	your dominant hand, followed by a second Cascade throw using the Column 
	ball. This will set you up to repeat the entire step again, creating one 
	continuous two ball pattern.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/triazzletwo2.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have the two ball pattern mastered, you will be 
	ready to add in the third ball. Start with two balls in your non-dominant 
	hand and one ball in your dominant. Make a Cascade throw from your 
	non-dominant hand to your dominant hand, and then follow it up with a second 
	Cascade throw from your non-dominant hand paired with a simultaneous 
	horizontal pass from your dominant hand. This pass will clear space for your 
	dominant hand to catch the first ball, which will then be thrown vertically 
	to clear space for your dominant hand to catch the second ball (these throws 
	should feel very familiar). As the vertical ball begins to descend back 
	toward your dominant hand, make a Cascade throw from your dominant hand to 
	your non-dominant hand, clearing space for your dominant hand to catch the 
	vertical ball. After that ball has been caught, make another Cascade throw 
	from your dominant hand, while simultaneously making a horizontal pass from 
	your non-dominant hand to your now empty dominant hand. Then catch the two 
	other balls with your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/triazzlethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. As with the previous step, once 
	you have one cycle of this step mastered, you will want to do the pattern 
	continuously to maximize its instructional impact. Instead of stopping after 
	making the horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand (after which the 
	animation shown above simply catches the rest of the balls), you are going 
	to follow it up with a vertical throw from your non-dominant hand, allowing 
	the whole cycle to repeat again and form one continuous pattern.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/triazzlefull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you may have noticed, this pattern contains all the throws 
	present in the full Triazzle, lacking only the side-to-side arm movements. 
	To add them in, perform the pattern shown above and then, as you make a 
	vertical throw from one hand, cross your other hand underneath the throwing 
	hand. As the vertical ball descends and the throwing hand tosses its other ball, 
	uncross your other hand and continue the pattern.<img alt="" class="smallanim" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/triazzlefull2.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To run the full Triazzle, simply 
	make those arm motions after every vertical throw. For such a simply 
	pattern, it may take a surprising amount of practice to achieve true 
	proficiency, since the pattern uses a wide variety of throws and movements.&nbsp; </p>
