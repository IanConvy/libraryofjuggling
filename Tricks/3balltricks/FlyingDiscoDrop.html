	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Flying Disco Drop is a 
	humorously named three ball pattern established by
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCihS_nPuybkG0jKQJf8l3nA">
	Idiosensory</a>. The trick combines lofty crossing throws with a rather 
	unique pass/drop combination, producing a large and impressive double-arch 
	effect. The Flying Disco Drop is closely related to the Hands of Time 
	pattern, so much so that prior experience with the latter pattern makes the 
	former much easier to learn. 
	That being said this tutorial will assume you only know basic three ball 
	juggling.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Flying Disco Drop, start with one ball 
	in each hand. Bring your non-dominant hand to the center of your body, and 
	then simultaneously make a high crossing throw from your dominant hand and a 
	nearly vertical pass from your non-dominant hand to your now empty dominant 
	hand. The pass should be caught at around head height. You will then hold 
	the ball in your dominant hand up in the air until the other ball reaches 
	its peak, making sure to shift your dominant hand over slightly to the 
	center of your body. When the other ball reaches its peak and begins to 
	descend you are going to drop the ball in your dominant hand so that it 
	follows a similar arc to the other ball (just a lot lower). You will then 
	rapidly bring your dominant hand down and around to catch the ball it just 
	dropped, while at the same time catching the other ball above it in your 
	non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/flyingdiscodroptwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the third 
	ball, start with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your 
	non-dominant hand. Make a high crossing throw from your dominant hand and 
	then, as that ball descends, perform the same throws you did in step one, 
	catching the high crossing throw you previously made in your now empty 
	non-dominant hand. As you carry and then drop the ball in your dominant hand 
	(as you did in step one) you are going to make an under-the arm vertical 
	throw from your non-dominant hand along the dominant side of your body, 
	clearing space for that hand to catch the top ball while your dominant hand 
	catches the bottom ball (as you also did in step one). The vertical ball 
	will then be caught by you dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/flyingdiscodropthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. There is just one more throw 
	left to complete the cycle. Start by performing all of the same throws and 
	catches that you did in step two, except before you catch the vertical ball 
	at the end you are going to make a high under-the-arm throw from your 
	dominant hand back toward the dominant side of your body, clearing space for 
	your dominant hand to catch the vertical ball. Your dominant hand will then 
	also catch the high ball it just threw.<img class="smallanim" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/flyingdiscodropfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As always, practice this on both sides. Notice how the last 
	throw is almost a mirror image of the first throw, albeit slightly taller. 
	To run the full pattern simply make another simultaneous throw/pass 
	combination, this time on the non-dominant side of your body, with your 
	hands in the opposite configuration. The Flying Disco Drop is a very fun 
	pattern to watch and juggle, with a difficulty level low enough for it to be 
	fairly accessible even to beginners. </p>
