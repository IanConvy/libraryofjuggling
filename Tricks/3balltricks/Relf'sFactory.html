	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relf&#39;s Factory is a variation 
	of the Factory pattern in which a circular arm flourish is added before each 
	drop. This gives a more flowing and smooth aesthetic to the otherwise 
	angular Factory, while also adding in some complexity and difficulty. Before 
	attempting Relf&#39;s Factory it is of course important that you already be very 
	comfortable juggling the regular Factory, and it might also help to know 
	Mangham&#39;s Mangle.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Relf&#39;s Factory, start with two balls in 
	your non-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant hand. Swing your 
	dominant hand up and around in a circle while simultaneously making a fairly 
	short two-in-one throw from your non-dominant hand. The throw should occur 
	at roughly the same time that your dominant hand is on the non-dominant side 
	of your body, so the throw will be made under-the-arm. As the thrown ball 
	peaks your dominant hand should move underneath it and then back up to 
	roughly where the circle started. You will then make a second throw from 
	your non-dominant hand, this time a crossing throw toward the dominant side 
	of your body, clearing space for your non-dominant hand to catch the first 
	ball it threw. Your dominant hand, having just finished its circle, will 
	then shift horizontally over to the non-dominant side of your body such that 
	it arrives right as the crossing throw peaks. You will then bring the hand 
	back down to catch the crossing throw.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. For the next step you 
	are going to drop the ball from your dominant hand after it finishes its 
	horizontal shift. You will then use your now empty dominant hand to snatch 
	the crossing ball (thrown by your non-dominant hand) as it peaks and begins 
	to descend. This is essentially identical to what occurs in the regular 
	Factory. As your dominant hand is snatching its ball you will simultaneously 
	make a second crossing throw, roughly identical to the first, from your 
	non-dominant hand. This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch 
	the ball that your dominant hand just dropped. You will then bring your 
	dominant hand down to catch the second crossing throw.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsfactoryfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again you should practice this on both sides as shown. 
	You have just completed one full cycle of Relf&#39;s Factory. To continue the 
	pattern simply make a two-in-one style throw from your dominant hand while 
	simultaneously starting a circular arm flourish with your non-dominant hand 
	(this is basically just a mirror image of how you started the first cycle), 
	and then repeat the whole process again. Relf&#39;s Factory is not a very hard 
	pattern, so if you are looking for an easy way to spice up the regular 
	Factory then this is a good choice.</p>
