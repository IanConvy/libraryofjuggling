	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Kraken is a three ball 
	pattern reminiscent of Mills Mess in which balls along the outside are 
	claw-caught and then released in such a manner that they seem to stall in 
	midair. This gives the pattern an odd, start-and-stop aesthetic that is 
	fairly unique among Mills Mess style tricks.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Kraken, start with one ball in each hand. Cross 
	your arms such that your dominant hand is over your non-dominant hand, and 
	then make a vertical under-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand. As 
	that ball reaches it peak, make a vertical throw from your dominant hand and 
	then uncross your arms, claw catching the first ball with your dominant hand 
	while catching the second ball with your non-dominant hand (the balls have 
	each been caught by the hand that did not throw them).<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/krakentwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To add in the third ball, start 
	with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. 
	Cross your dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand, and then make a 
	vertical throw from your dominant hand. Once that ball reaches its peak, 
	make a vertical throw from your non-dominant hand and then uncross your 
	non-dominant hand (leaving your dominant hand where it was before). Claw 
	catch the first ball with your non-dominant hand, and then make a second 
	vertical throw from your dominant hand (your non-dominant hand should be 
	above it). This will clear space for your dominant hand to catch the second 
	ball (the vertical throw made from your non-dominant hand before it 
	uncrossed). The third ball will then be caught from above with your 
	non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/krakenthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. For the next step, you 
	are going to do the same throws shown above, but instead of simply catching 
	the last ball with your non-dominant hand, you are going to first make small 
	throw from your non-dominant hand (which should still be facing palm down), 
	clearing space for that hand to claw catch the last ball. The throw from 
	your non-dominant hand should be very light, and in fact more closely 
	resembles a simple drop. After your non-dominant hand claw catches its ball, 
	you are going to cross it underneath your dominant hand, which itself is 
	going to cross over and catch the ball dropped from your non-dominant hand. 
	Thus your hands will end up crossed in the opposite configuration from when 
	they started (note that the animation below cheats, since it doesn&#39;t uncross 
	and recross its hands when it begins a new cycle).<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/krakenthree2.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. For the next step, we are going 
	to add in the final throw of the cycle. Perform the throws described in the 
	previous step, but instead of simply catching the last ball with your 
	dominant hand (the ball that was dropped by your non-dominant hand), you are 
	going to make a throw from the outside of your body toward the center of 
	your body using your dominant hand. You will then cross your dominant hand 
	over your non-dominant hand and catch the dropped ball previously discussed. 
	The ball just thrown from your dominant hand will be caught by your 
	non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/krakenthree3.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. At this point we have 
	completed one full cycle of the Kraken. From here, you might intuitively be 
	able to figure out how the cycles connect, at which point you will be able 
	to juggle the full pattern. If however you are not quite able to see the 
	continuation, there is one more step to practice. Start by juggling one full 
	cycle (i.e. juggle the previous step) and then, instead of simply catching 
	the last ball with your non-dominant hand, you are going to make a vertical 
	throw from your non-dominant hand along the outside of that ball, clearing 
	space for your non-dominant hand to catch it. At this point your dominant 
	hand should be crossed over your non-dominant hand. As that outside vertical 
	ball just thrown by your non-dominant hand reaches its peak, you are going 
	to make a vertical throw from your dominant hand and then uncross that hand, 
	claw catching the vertical ball thrown from your non-dominant hand. You will then catch the vertical ball just 
	thrown from your dominant hand with your non-dominant hand.<img alt="" class="smallanim" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/krakenfull.gif" width="400" /> 
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. Notice how the final 
	claw catch mirrors the claw catch performed at the beginning. That last claw 
	catch signals the beginning of a new cycle (on the opposite side of your 
	body). To juggle the full Kraken, simply make another vertical throw 
	underneath the claw-caught ball, and repeat the same throws and catches that 
	you&#39;ve been practicing in the previous steps. By this point, your brain will 
	likely be familiar enough with the pattern to repeat the cycle on its own, 
	but if you get stuck, simply refer back the previous steps. The Kraken has 
	an odd rhythm that will take some practice to master, so expect to spend a 
	decent amount of time working with this pattern. </p>
