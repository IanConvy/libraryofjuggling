	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Statue of Liberty is a 
	three ball shape distortion of the Half-Shower in which one hand, extended 
	above the head, drops balls to a feeder hand down below, which in turn 
	throws them back to the raised hand. As you can probably figure out, the 
	name of this pattern is derived from the shape your body makes when 
	performing the trick. The Statue of Liberty is fairly easy to learn, but the 
	massive height difference between hands can take a while to get used to.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Statue of Liberty, it is best to begin with just 
	two balls. Start with one ball in each hand, and then take your dominant 
	hand and raise it above your head such that your arm is almost fully 
	extended. With your non-dominant hand, make a throw toward your dominant 
	hand such that the ball peaks about six inches above that hand. As that ball 
	reaches its peak, drop the ball in your dominant hand toward your 
	non-dominant hand, clearing space for your dominant hand to catch the first 
	ball. Your non-dominant hand will then catch the dropped ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/statueoflibertytwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will likely feel awkward at first, though the throws 
	will become more natural to you with practice. To add in the third ball, 
	start with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your 
	non-dominant. Raise your non-dominant hand above your head, as done in the 
	previous step, and then make a throw from your dominant hand toward your 
	non-dominant hand. As that ball reaches its peak, drop the ball in your 
	non-dominant hand (as done in the previous step) down to your dominant hand. 
	This drop will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the first 
	ball. Immediately follow the drop with a second throw from your dominant 
	hand, clearing space for you to catch the dropped ball. The second ball 
	thrown from your dominant hand will then approach your non-dominant hand, 
	which will drop another ball down to your dominant hand, clearing space for 
	the second ball to be caught. Lastly, the dropped ball will be caught by 
	your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/statueoflibertythree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this extensively. To run the full Statue of Liberty, 
	simply keep making high throws from your dominant hand paired with drops 
	from your non-dominant hand. This pattern is simple and easy, but quite 
	popular with spectators, making it a good choice for performances. </p>
