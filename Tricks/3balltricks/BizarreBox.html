	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bizarre Box is an odd 
	variation of the Box in which the horizontal pass is made to the same hand 
	that threw it. This is achieved by throwing the ball from one side of your 
	body and then crossing the passing hand to the opposite side to catch it. 
	This peculiar horizontal pass gives the Bizarre Box a unique aesthetic while 
	also making it one of the most difficult Box variations to master.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Bizarre Box, start with just one ball in your 
	dominant hand. Make a very low throw toward the non-dominant side of your 
	body, and then cross your dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand 
	(which should itself be crossing over to your dominant side). If done 
	correctly, the ball you just threw should pass over your non-dominant hand 
	and then be caught under-the-arm by your dominant hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides (although you may want to run 
	through the entire tutorial for one side, and then go through it all again 
	for the other side). It is important that you be able to perform this &quot;pass&quot; 
	consistently, since you will have to do it while juggling two other balls. 
	To add in the second ball, start with one ball in each hand. Make a vertical 
	throw from your non-dominant hand, and then perform the pass/arm crossing 
	done in step one. As the vertical ball begins to descend, uncross your arms 
	and catch the ball in your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bizarreboxtwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice these two throws<strong> extensively</strong>. This 
	step will likely feel very awkward at first, with your hands naturally 
	wanting to make throws of complementary height and direction. With practice 
	however this step will become almost second nature. To add in the third 
	ball, start with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your 
	non-dominant. Make a vertical throw from your dominant hand and then, as 
	that ball begins to descend, make the vertical throw/horizontal &quot;pass&quot; 
	combination done in step two. This time however, you are going to use your 
	non-dominant hand to catch the vertical throw made by your dominant hand. 
	Then catch the second vertical throw with your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bizarreboxthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown practice this on both sides (again, it might be 
	better to first practice all the way through on just one side). To add in 
	the final throws, do step three again, except make a vertical throw from 
	your non-dominant hand before it uncrosses, clearing space for you to catch 
	the previous vertical throw made from your non-dominant hand. As that 
	vertical throw from your non-dominant hand begins to descend (it should be 
	located on the dominant side of your body), make a vertical throw from your 
	non-dominant hand along with a horizontal pass from your dominant hand, 
	clearing space for your dominant hand to catch that descending vertical 
	ball. Then catch the vertical ball just thrown with your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bizarreboxfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until you can do all the throws consistently. 
	To run the full Bizarre Box, just make another vertical throw/crossed-arm 
	&quot;pass&quot; combination as the last vertical throw shown in the previous step 
	begins to descend. This will set you up for a new cycle, after which you 
	will simply continue to repeat the pattern on alternating sides of your 
	body. </p>
