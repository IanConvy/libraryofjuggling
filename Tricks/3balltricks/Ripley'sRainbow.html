	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ripley&#39;s Rainbow is a three 
	ball pattern invented by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/qiixy">Cliff 
	Ripley</a>. The trick has a rushed, side-to-side rhythm reminiscent of the 
	Snake, with multiplexes adding an extra layer of complexity. There are no 
	clear prerequisites for this pattern, but it is recommended that you already 
	be fairly comfortable with multiplexing before attempting the trick.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Ripley&#39;s Rainbow, start with two balls in 
	your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Throw the ball in 
	your non-dominant hand over toward your dominant hand and then, as that ball 
	begins to descend, make a split-multiplex throw from your dominant hand over 
	the first ball. This will clear space for your dominant hand to catch that 
	ball. As the multiplexed balls begin to descend, you will throw the ball in 
	your dominant hand along roughly the same arc as the multiplex, clearing 
	space for your dominant hand to catch the multiplexed ball closest to 
	it—your non-dominant hand will catch the other multiplexed ball. You will 
	then catch the last ball in your non-dominant hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. For the next step, you 
	are going to make another throw from your dominant hand along the same arc 
	as the last ball thrown from that hand (the final ball thrown in the 
	previous step). You will then make a split-multiplex throw from your 
	non-dominant hand back toward your dominant hand, clearing space for your 
	non-dominant hand to catch the ball just thrown from your dominant hand. You 
	will then catch the multiplexed balls.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this on both sides. Notice that the last 
	two throws were a mirror image of the first two throws—to continue the 
	pattern, simply make the same throws/catches you normally would, except with 
	your hands reversed. Ripley&#39;s Rainbow is a fairly simple pattern, but when 
	performed fast and low it can be pleasantly challenging to juggle. </p>
