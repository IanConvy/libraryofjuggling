	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Broken Shower (unofficial 
	name) is a variation of the Shower in which the high throw is caught 
	under-the-arm, giving the pattern a very lopsided feel. This trick can also 
	be seen as a Shower with continuous Tossouts. I gave the Broken Shower its 
	name based on its resemblance to the Broken Box, which also uses an underarm 
	catch. Before attempting the Broken Shower, it would be wise to learn the 
	Shower Cascade, since that pattern prepare you for the underarm catch. <br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Broken Shower, start with one ball in each hand. 
	Bring your dominant hand to the center of your body, and then raise it up 
	about six inches. Make a fairly high throw from your dominant hand toward 
	the dominant side of your body (the opposite direction of a normal Shower), 
	while simultaneously making a pass from your non-dominant hand (which should 
	be raised higher than your dominant hand). After your non-dominant hand 
	makes the pass, continue the motion so that your non-dominant hand crosses 
	underneath your dominant hand. Use it to catch the high throw.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/brokenshowertwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until you can do the throw/pass combination 
	consistently. For the next step, you are going to once again start with one 
	ball in each hand. This time however, you are going to make a high throw 
	from your dominant hand without the corresponding pass from your 
	non-dominant hand. As that ball reaches its peak and begins to descend, make 
	a pass from your non-dominant hand, and then cross that hand underneath your 
	dominant arm to catch the high throw.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/brokenshowertwo2.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice these two throw until you can do them 
	consistently. To add in the third ball, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a high throw from your 
	dominant hand at the center of your body (as done in the previous steps) and 
	then, as that ball descends toward your dominant side, make a second high 
	throw from your dominant hand paired with a pass from your non-dominant hand 
	(as done in step one). Cross your non-dominant hand underneath your dominant 
	arm and then catch the first high throw (as done in step two). Then uncross 
	your non-dominant hand, catching the second high throw in your dominant 
	hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/brokenshowerthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice these three throws extensively. To run the full 
	Broken Shower, simply make another throw/pass combination as the second high 
	throw begins to descend. Instead of catching that ball with your dominant 
	hand (as done in the step above), you are going to cross over and catch it 
	with your non-dominant hand, thus replicating the previous throw/pass 
	combination. The cycle then simply repeats. </p>
