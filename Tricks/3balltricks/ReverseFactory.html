	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reverse Factory is, as it 
	sounds, a time-reversed variation of the Factory. Instead of raising a ball 
	up and dropping it, you instead grab a ball out of the air and then carry it 
	back down. This offers a very interesting twist on the original pattern, 
	while still maintaining the same sense of rigidity and angularity.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Reverse Factory, start with one ball in 
	each hand. Rotate your dominant hand so that your palm is facing down, and 
	then simultaneously make a vertical throw from each hand. Maintain the 
	upward motion of your dominant hand and grab the ball thrown from your 
	non-dominant hand as it reaches its peak. As the other ball descends, shift 
	your dominant hand horizontally such that it returns to the dominant side of 
	your body while still remaining up in the air, catching the other ball with 
	your non-dominant hand as your dominant hand completes its motion.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/reversefactorytwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this step extensively, so that it feels very 
	natural. To add in the third ball, start with two balls in your non-dominant 
	hand and one ball in your dominant. Make the same two throws that you did in 
	the previous step and then perform the same horizontal carry, but before you 
	catch the ball thrown from your dominant hand make a second vertical throw 
	from your non-dominant hand at the same height and position as the first. 
	This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the ball thrown 
	from your dominant hand at the start. At this point your dominant hand 
	should have finished its horizontal shift and the ball just thrown from your 
	non-dominant hand should be reaching its peak. As that ball descends you are 
	going carry the ball in your dominant hand downward vertically at the same 
	speed such that the two balls remain horizontally aligned. You will then 
	catch the last ball with your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/reversefactorythree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until it is comfortable. For the last step you 
	are going to make a third vertical throw from your non-dominant hand along 
	the center of your body as the second ball thrown from your non-dominant 
	hand descends toward it. This throw will then be caught by your non-dominant 
	hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/reversefactoryfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have just completed one full cycle of the Reverse 
	Factory. To begin another cycle, simply make another set of simultaneous 
	vertical throws and catch the middle ball with your non-dominant hand. The 
	Reverse Factory is a rare yet fairly easy pattern to learn, good for a 
	beginner who wants something more interesting. </p>
