	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Crossed-Arm Reverse Cascade 
	is a variation of the Crossed-Arm Cascade in which each ball is thrown over, 
	rather than under, the previous throw. This is in fact the most comfortable 
	way to juggle a Crossed-Arm Cascade. Since this trick is so similar to the 
	Crossed-Arm Cascade, <a href="CrossedArmCascade.html">that tutorial</a> can 
	essentially be adapted to this pattern by simply making overthrows instead 
	of underthrows. For example, in the first step you will want to cross your 
	arms and then make one throw from each hand such that your non-dominant is 
	throwing its ball <em>over</em> the ball from the first throw. This can be 
	done easily by aiming your throws more toward the center of your body.</p>
