	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hands of Time is a three ball 
	pattern established by
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Idiosensory">Idiosensory</a>.&nbsp; It can be thought of as a fusion of the Windmill 
	pattern with a highly distorted Shower, where the horizontal pass is made at 
	an upward angle across a larger distance. This leads to a more voluminous pattern with 
	dramatic arm motions, relying more on visual impressiveness than technical 
	difficulty.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Hands of Time, start with one ball in each 
	hand. Simultaneously make a high vertical throw from your dominant hand and 
	a pass from your non-dominant hand to your dominant hand. The pass should be 
	angled diagonally upward from the center of your body and caught by your 
	dominant hand at between shoulder to forehead height. Your dominant hand 
	should then be extended such that it is slightly lower than the high ball. 
	As that ball begins to descend your dominant hand will follow beneath it 
	(and slightly off to the side). The high ball will then be caught by your 
	non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/handsoftimetwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To add in the third ball, start 
	with one ball in your dominant hand and two balls in your non-dominant hand. 
	Make the same simultaneous throws you just performed in step one, but this 
	time, as the high vertical ball descends, you are going to make a crossing 
	throw from your non-dominant hand before reaching over to grab the high 
	ball. You are then going to cross your dominant hand, which has just 
	finished following the high ball&#39;s descent, over to the non-dominant side of 
	your body, where it will make an under-the-arm throw back toward the center 
	of your body. This should feel very similar to the Windmill. Your dominant 
	hand will then uncross and catch the ball previously thrown by your 
	non-dominant hand, and then also catch its own under-the-arm throw.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/handsoftimefull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. You have just 
	completed one full cycle of the Hands of Time. To run the pattern 
	continuously simply make the same simultaneous pair of throws (high throw and 
	pass) you made in step one, except on the opposite side of your body, 
	catching the last throw of the previous cycle with your dominant hand (the 
	hand that made the pass). This will set you up for the next cycle, which 
	will be a mirror image of the previous one. Hands of Time is an easy 
	pattern to learn, but making the arm motions appear fluid and smooth can 
	take quite a bit of practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
