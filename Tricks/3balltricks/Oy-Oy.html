	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Oy-Oy is variation of the 
	Yo-Yo in which an outside ball is carried underneath, instead of above, the 
	center ball. The Oy-Oy is slightly more difficult than the Yo-Yo, however 
	once you have learned the latter this trick should not give you any 
	problems. It would probably be best to start out practicing just the &quot;fake&quot; 
	part of the pattern (like you did when learning the Yo-Yo), and then combine 
	it into the Columns pattern. </p>
