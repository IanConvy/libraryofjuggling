	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Forklift is a unique three 
	ball pattern established by <a href="http://www.michaelkaras.net/">Michael 
	Karas</a> which combines a split multiplex with an odd throw made from the 
	top of your hand called a Fork. This Fork quickly separates the multiplexed 
	balls, allowing for extra throws/catches to be made while also creating a 
	very unique aesthetic. The actual throws made in the Forklift are fairly 
	simple, but controlling the Fork &quot;throw&quot; takes a fair amount of practice.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Forklift, it is best to begin by practicing the 
	Fork. Start with two balls in your non-dominant hand, and then make a fairly 
	vertical throw at the center of your body. As this ball reaches its peak, 
	you are going to make a second vertical throw underneath it from your 
	non-dominant hand while simultaneously pushing the first ball upwards using 
	the first two fingers of your dominant hand (your palm should be facing 
	downward). If done correctly, the first ball should stay in the same 
	vertical column as the second ball, and the distance between the two balls 
	should remain roughly the same. After the Fork, you are going to bring your 
	dominant hand down and claw catch the second ball, allowing the first ball 
	to fall into your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/forklifttwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides, making sure that the Fork is 
	done in a controlled manner. To add in the third ball, start with two balls 
	in your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a normal 
	Cascade throw from your non-dominant hand, and then do a split multiplex 
	from your dominant hand, clearing space for that hand to catch the first 
	throw. After that ball is caught, you are going to bring your dominant hand 
	underneath the multiplexed ball that is farthest away from your dominant 
	side. Simultaneously, you are going to bring your non-dominant hand directly 
	underneath the multiplexed ball closest to it (the same ball that your 
	dominant hand is now under). Once your hands are in these positions, you are 
	going to make a vertical throw from your dominant hand, immediately followed 
	by a vertical Fork &quot;throw&quot;. These two throws are identical to the ones 
	practiced in step one. Your dominant hand will now be free to catch the 
	other multiplexed ball, while your non-dominant hand will claw catch the 
	vertical ball just thrown from your dominant hand. The Forked ball will then 
	be caught by your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/forkliftthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, practice this on both sides. To finish the 
	cycle, you are going to make a second vertical throw along the outside of 
	your body from your dominant hand to clear space for the Forked ball to be 
	caught. You will then take your non-dominant hand, which has just claw 
	caught a ball, and swing it up and around to the outside of your body, claw 
	catching the ball just thrown from your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/forkliftfull.gif" width="392" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. You may have noticed 
	that this step finishes with a ball configuration that is opposite of the 
	one you started with. To run another cycle and continue the full Forklift 
	pattern, you simply need to make another Cascade throw (with the other hand 
	this time) after you swing your arm around to catch the final ball. The 
	Forklift is an intermediate pattern, and as such it may take a couple of 
	days to fully master. Remember, to achieve the best aesthetic, you will want 
	to make your Fork &quot;throw&quot; as vertical as possible.</p>
