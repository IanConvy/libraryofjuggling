	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The W, also known as the 
	Columns 423, is a variation of the 423 in which each ball is thrown along 
	the same vertical path, with you hands moving between the outside and inside 
	balls. This pattern is not particularly interesting or impressive, but can 
	serve as a building block for more complex tricks like the Boston Mess.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn The W, start with two balls in your dominant hand 
	and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a vertical throw with your dominant 
	hand, and then bring your dominant hand to the center of your body and make 
	a vertical throw. As that ball begin to descend, make a vertical throw from 
	your non-dominant hand and then catch the center ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/thewthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To run the full 
	pattern, just throw the center ball again, and continue alternating between 
	outside and inside throws.</p>
