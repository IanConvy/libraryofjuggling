	<p id="description">&nbsp;The Yo-Yo is a variation of Fake Columns in which 
	the &quot;faked&quot; ball is moved on top of the center ball, as if they were 
	attached by a string (hence the name). Like Fake Columns, the Yo-Yo is a 
	favorite among younger audiences, and is in fact very easy to juggle.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only tricky part of the Yo-Yo is the vertical carry, 
	since you must make sure that the space between the two balls stays roughly 
	the same, or else the effect will be severely diminished. Therefore, you should 
	start with two balls, and practice just the fake.<img alt=""  height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/yoyotwo.gif" width="400" class="smallanim" />&nbsp;
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have that part down, you can begin to incorporate 
	the Yo-Yo into your normal Columns pattern, starting with just one or two in 
	a row and working your way up to doing the trick constantly. </p>
