	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Symmetric Georgian Scuffle 
	is, as it sounds, the symmetrical variation of the Georgian Scuffle, 
	established by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thegoheads">Steve Hoggan</a>. 
	It could also be thought of as a variation of the Kraken, but for the sake 
	of this tutorial I am going to assume you are approaching this pattern with 
	the Georgian Scuffle already mastered on both sides, rather than the Kraken. 
	Of course, it would certainly help if you are familiar with both patterns.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Symmetric Georgian Scuffle, you are 
	going to start with the last throws of the asymmetric Georgian Scuffle. 
	Notice how after you claw catch the center ball your hand is circles over 
	and around another ball. For the Symmetric Georgian Scuffle, you are instead 
	going to cross that hand (lets say your dominant hand in this case) 
	underneath your other hand (in this case your non-dominant hand). As your 
	dominant hand approaches your non-dominant hand, you are going to make a 
	throw from your non-dominant hand toward the center of your body, and then 
	cross the hand over your dominant hand and catch the vertical ball dropped 
	on the dominant side of your body. You will then catch the ball your 
	non-dominant hand just threw using your dominant hand (which is still 
	crossed underneath your non-dominant hand).<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/symgeorgianscufflethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To finish the pattern, you are 
	going to make a vertical throw from your dominant hand along the 
	non-dominant side of your body, clearing space for you to catch the ball 
	thrown at the end of the previous step. At the same time, you are going to 
	circle your non-dominant hand (which at this point is still crossed over 
	your dominant hand) over and around the vertical ball just thrown from your 
	dominant hand, catching the ball as you finish the motion.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/symgeorgianscufflefull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this on both sides. To run the full 
	pattern, simply make a fake throw from your dominant hand as your 
	non-dominant hand scoops up the last ball. This will set you up to repeat 
	the pattern on the opposite side of your body. Like its asymmetric 
	counterpart, the Symmetric Georgian Scuffle benefits aesthetically from a 
	quick pace, so practice is necessary in order to perform the trick at its 
	full potential.&nbsp; </p>
