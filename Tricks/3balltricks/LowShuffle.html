	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Low Shuffle (improvised 
	name) is a variation of the standard Shuffle pattern in which all the 
	non-slammed balls are thrown beneath the slammed ball. This leads to a more 
	compressed pattern, and higher odds of collision. For that reason, the Low 
	Shuffle is more difficult than the normal Shuffle, therefore you should 
	learn the latter before trying this trick.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming you know the regular Shuffle, the only step to 
	learning the Low Shuffle is to practice a single slam. Start with two balls 
	in your non-dominant hand, and one ball in your dominant. Make a low Cascade 
	throw from your non-dominant hand. At the same time, raise up your dominant 
	hand and prepare to make a slam. As the first ball passes its peak and 
	begins to fall back down, make another low Cascade throw while almost 
	simultaneously doing a slam with your dominant hand, catching that ball with 
	your non-dominant hand and claw catching the first ball with your dominant 
	hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/lowshufflerun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#39;s pretty much it. Just keep adding throws as you 
	become more comfortable with the throws, and with some practice you will be 
	able to run the Low Shuffle for extended periods of time.</p>
