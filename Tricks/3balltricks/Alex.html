	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alex is a difficult three ball 
	pattern established by William Penman as part of his
	<a href="http://unknownjuggling.tripod.com/hurricaneseries.html">Hurricane 
	Series</a>. It contains an odd mix of synchronous throws, high throws, and 
	wrist-drops. The trick has a very rushed cadence, and this, along with its 
	wide variety of throws, makes Alex quite hard to master. There are no true 
	prerequisite patterns, but it would probably help to be well versed in 
	general three ball juggling before attempting this trick.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Alex, start with one ball in each hand. 
	Cross your dominant hand over your non-dominant hand, but keep both hands 
	fairly close to the center of your body. Simultaneously, make a roughly 
	vertical throw from each hand such that the ball from your dominant hand 
	goes roughly twice as high as the ball thrown from your non-dominant hand 
	(measured from the palm of your hand). As the lower ball reaches its peak, 
	you are going to grab it out of the air with your dominant hand and then 
	recross your arms such that the palm of your dominant hand is pointing 
	toward the ground. You will catch the second ball under-the-arm with your 
	non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alextwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. For the next step, you are going 
	to add in the wrist-drop. A wrist-drop occurs when, in a crossed-arm 
	position, the top hand releases its ball and then quickly uncrosses and 
	recrosses underneath the other hand, catching the ball that it had just 
	released. In Alex the wrist-drop occurs after the first catch of the 
	previous step, when your dominant hand grabs the lower ball. After that 
	catch is made, you are going to release the ball in your dominant hand with 
	a small amount of upward movement, giving you enough time to recross your 
	dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand, catching the released ball 
	palm-up as your hand moves into position. The other ball should be caught by 
	your non-dominant just as you begin to uncross your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alextwo2.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the third 
	ball, you are going to start with two balls in your dominant hand and one 
	ball in your non-dominant. Make a high vertical throw from your dominant 
	hand along the outside of your body, then cross your dominant hand over your 
	non-dominant hand and make the simultaneous throws from the previous two 
	steps, catching the outside vertical ball with your now empty non-dominant 
	hand (which at this point is crossed underneath your dominant hand). Grab 
	the lower ball out of the air with your dominant hand and execute the 
	wrist-drop from step two. As you do this, you are also going to make a high 
	throw from your non-dominant hand along the outside of the upper ball, which 
	should now be descending toward your non-dominant hand where it will then be 
	caught. The high ball will then be caught by your dominant hand, which 
	should now be crossed underneath your non-dominant hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this extensively on both sides. To run the full 
	pattern, simply make another set of simultaneous throws underneath the last 
	high ball, setting up a new cycle on the opposite side of your body. Alex is 
	not an easy trick, and will most likely take a week or two of practice to 
	get solid. </p>
