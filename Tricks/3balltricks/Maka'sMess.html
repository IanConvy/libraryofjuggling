	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maka&#39;s Mess is a three ball 
	pattern established by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Idiosensory">
	Idiosensory</a>. The trick combines a 
	wrist drop with two lofty throws made to somewhat resemble Mills Mess. If 
	you are already comfortable with wrist drops then Maka&#39;s Mess should not be 
	too difficult to learn, as the other throws are simple and slow.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Maka&#39;s Mess, start with one ball in each 
	hand. Cross your dominant hand over your non-dominant hand, palm facing down, 
	and then simultaneously make a high under-the-arm throw from your 
	non-dominant hand toward the center of your body while basically dropping 
	the ball in your dominant hand (you will still want to give it a bit of 
	upward motion). You will then quickly uncross your dominant hand and then 
	recross it underneath your non-dominant hand to under-the-arm catch the ball 
	your dominant hand just dropped. The high under-the-arm throw made by your 
	non-dominant hand will then be caught by your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/makasmesstwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the third 
	ball, start with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your 
	non-dominant hand. Make a high throw from your dominant hand toward the 
	center of your body and then cross your dominant hand over your non-dominant 
	hand. As that ball peaks and begins to descend, perform the same two throws 
	that you did in step one, catching the first ball you threw with your 
	now empty non-dominant hand followed closely by your dominant hand 
	under-the-arm catching the ball it dropped. As the high ball thrown by your 
	non-dominant hand begins to descend you are going to make another high throw 
	from your non-dominant hand toward the center of your body, clearing space 
	for your non-dominant hand to catch the first high ball it threw. The 
	last ball will then be caught by your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="454" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/makasmessfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. Notice how the last throw is a 
	mirror image of the first throw. To run the full pattern simply make another 
	simultaneous high throw/wrist drop combination using the opposite hand 
	configuration and continue on from there. Once you are comfortable making 
	wrist drops Maka&#39;s Mess becomes a fairly easy pattern, though getting the 
	high throws to curve correctly can take a bit of effort. </p>
