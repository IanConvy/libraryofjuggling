	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Factory is a simple but 
	impressive trick that uses one arm to carry a ball over the entire pattern 
	and drop it as if on an assembly line (hence the name). The trick is best 
	performed with rigid, robotic arm movements, and is in fact also known as 
	the Robot. The unusual motion of the Factory makes it crowd favorite, 
	particularly among younger audiences.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the trick, it&#39;s useful to think of it first as a 
	modified Fake Columns, with a &quot;fake&quot; that travels over the pattern.<img alt=""  height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/factoryfake.gif" width="400" class="smallanim" />&nbsp;
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this arm motion until you can execute it smoothly 
	without interrupting the balls being thrown. Next we are going to add in the 
	actual drop and catch. Start with a basic Fake Columns, and then start to do 
	the pattern above, except this time you are going to release the ball once 
	your hand reaches the other side, and then claw catch the center ball.<img alt=""  height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/factoryonce.gif" width="400" class="smallanim" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is going to probably be the most difficult&nbsp; stage 
	of learning the Factory, since the coordination of your arm movements and 
	your throws will likely lead to mix ups. Once you can do one cycle of the 
	factory smoothly and consistently, you can start chaining them together to 
	get the full Factory. </p>
