	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King of Hearts is a variation 
	of the Kingston Shuffle established by
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Idiosensory?feature=watch">Idiosensory</a> 
	in which the &quot;fake&quot; toss is replaced by a normal Cascade throw, which is 
	then followed by an overthrow and arm flourish after catching the top ball 
	of the multiplex. These changes give King of Hearts a more fluid feel, and 
	make it generally easier to juggle, especially if you are already familiar 
	with similar patterns such as Orka&#39;s Mess. It is not necessary to know the 
	Kingston Shuffle before attempting this trick, but it will help. This 
	tutorial however will assume you cannot already perform the pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn King of Hearts, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a normal Cascade throw 
	from your non-dominant hand, and then bring your dominant hand over to the 
	non-dominant side of your body and perform a stacked multiplex. With your 
	dominant hand now empty, catch the first ball, then bring your hand back 
	toward the center of your body and make a mostly vertical throw angled 
	toward your non-dominant hand. Catch the top multiplex ball as it&#39;s falling 
	back down with your now empty dominant hand, then swing that hand over and 
	around the ball it just threw while catching the bottom multiplex ball with 
	your non-dominant hand. Catch the previous throw from your dominant hand 
	with your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/kingofheartsthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the final 
	two throws, you are going to make a Column throw from your non-dominant hand 
	on the opposite side of your body while swinging your dominant hand between 
	that ball and the throw made from your dominant hand previously. You will 
	then catch the bottom multiplex ball with your non-dominant hand, while 
	bringing your dominant hand to the center of your body. As you make a 
	relatively vertical throw toward your non-dominant hand from your dominant 
	hand, you are going to raise your non-dominant hand up with the ball, such 
	that the distance between the thrown ball and your hand stays the same. As 
	you catch the Column ball thrown earlier with your dominant hand, and as the 
	vertical ball beneath your non-dominant hand reaches its peak, you are going 
	to bring your non-dominant hand downward and catch the ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/kingofheartsfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To run the full King 
	of Hearts, just add a Cascade throw with your dominant hand followed by a 
	multiplex from your non-dominant hand to the end of the this previous step. 
	This makes up the first portion of the next cycle, so just repeat the same 
	pattern of throws as you have been practicing. </p>
