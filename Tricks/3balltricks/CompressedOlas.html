	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compressed Olas (improvised 
	name) is a variation of the Olas pattern in which the revolving catch is 
	used on both multiplexed balls, instead of just the top one. This leads to a 
	smaller and quicker trick that may be slightly more difficult than its 
	slower parent pattern. While I would recommending learning normal Olas 
	before this variation, the two can really be learned in interchangeable 
	order. However, this tutorial will assume you already know the standard 
	pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the only real difference between normal Olas and 
	the Compressed form is the revolving catch, you will need to learn to grab 
	both multiplexed balls with that style of catch. Start with just two balls, 
	both in your non-dominant hand. Then, multiplex them as if juggling Olas, 
	but instead of tossing back the passed ball from the multiplex, you are 
	going to hold on to it and do a revolving catch on the second ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/olascomptwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. Notice how one hand is nothing 
	after each multiplex. The third ball will fit in there, being thrown before 
	the multiplex as if in the normal pattern, but in Compressed Olas the ball 
	is not passed into the revolving catch, and will instead be continuously 
	tossed over the multiplex for the duration of the trick. </p>
