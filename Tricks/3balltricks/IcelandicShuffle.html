	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Icelandic Shuffle is a 
	three ball pattern that I believe was established by
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/circusbj">Beejay Joyer</a>. It can 
	basically be seen as an asymmetric variation of the Kraken, in which one 
	ball is carried around the pattern in order to set up the next cycle. Like 
	the Kraken, the Icelandic Shuffle uses midair stalls, though it has 
	a more uneven pace than its symmetric counterpart.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Icelandic Shuffle, start with two balls 
	in your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your arms 
	such that your dominant hand is underneath your non-dominant hand, and then 
	make a vertical throw from your dominant hand. Immediately after,&nbsp;throw the ball in your non-dominant hand straight up, and then continue the 
	upward motion of your hand and direct it toward the ball thrown from your 
	dominant hand. You will claw catch the ball with your non-dominant hand 
	(leaving it suspended in midair), and 
	then make a vertical throw along the center of your body using your dominant 
	hand, clearing space for that hand to catch the ball thrown from your 
	non-dominant hand. You will then release the ball in your non-dominant hand 
	(which is being held in the air), and claw catch the the center ball as it 
	reaches its peak and begins to descend. The ball you released will be caught 
	by your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/icelandicshufflethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, you are going to change the way you catch the final 
	ball of the previous step. Instead of simply crossing your dominant hand and 
	catching the ball as it descends, you are going to make a throw from your 
	dominant hand on the dominant side of your body toward the center of your 
	body, and then cross your dominant hand over and claw catch the other ball 
	out of the air (the ball you simply let fall into your dominant hand at the 
	end of the previous step). As the ball thrown from your dominant hand travels 
	toward the center of your body, you are going to make a throw from your 
	non-dominant hand underneath that ball, toward the dominant side of your 
	body. This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the ball 
	thrown from your dominant hand. You will then also catch the ball thrown 
	from your non-dominant hand with your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/icelandicshufflenext.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice in the animation above that one of the hands (your 
	dominant hand) stays stuck awkwardly in the air after it claw catches one of 
	the balls. For the final step, your are going to swing that ball over the 
	top of the pattern as your non-dominant hand is making its throw (the last 
	throw of the previous step). As that ball thrown from your non-dominant hand 
	descends, you are going to make another throw from your non-dominant toward 
	the center of your body (biased a bit toward the dominant side of your 
	body). This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the ball it 
	threw previously. By this point your dominant hand should have finished 
	its arc around the pattern, where it will end up crossed under your 
	non-dominant hand (back where it started). You will then use it to catch the 
	ball just thrown from your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/icelandicshufflefull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have just completed one full cycle of the Icelandic 
	Shuffle. To continue the pattern, simply make an underarm throw from your 
	dominant hand after it crosses underneath your non-dominant hand. This will 
	clear space for the hand to catch the final ball from the last cycle and 
	also 
	create the first throw of the new cycle. The Icelandic Shuffle is a 
	fast-paced, compact pattern that will take a lot of practice to fully 
	control. Once mastered however, it becomes a enjoyable pattern to both watch 
	and juggle. </p>
