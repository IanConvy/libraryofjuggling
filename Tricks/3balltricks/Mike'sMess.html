	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike&#39;s Mess is a three ball 
	pattern established by Mike Day. It can best be described as a Cascade in which 
	every throw and catch is made under-the-arm, giving the trick a fairly 
	unique aesthetic. Before learning Mike&#39;s Mess, you should probably already 
	be comfortable with the Crossed-Arm Reverse Cascade in both arm 
	configurations.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Mike&#39;s Mess is a fairly simple pattern, there is really 
	only one intermediate step to practice. Start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your dominant arm 
	underneath your non-dominant arm, and then make a fairly high throw from 
	your dominant hand back toward the dominant side of your body. As that ball 
	is traveling through the air you will uncross and then recross your arms, 
	this time in the opposite configuration (dominant arm over non-dominant 
	arm). You will want to time this motion such that your non-dominant hand 
	comes into position as the ball in the air is descending. You will then make 
	an under-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand toward the non-dominant 
	side of your body (a mirror image of the first throw), clearing space for 
	your non-dominant hand to catch the first ball. The ball just thrown will 
	then be caught by your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/mikesmessthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides until you can perform the motions 
	smoothly and throw accurately. To perform the full pattern, simply repeat 
	the arm motions after every throw, making sure that you are both catching 
	and throwing under-the-arm. Mike&#39;s Mess is a pretty easy pattern, and can be 
	helpful when learning Mills Mess.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
