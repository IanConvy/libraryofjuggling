	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romeo&#39;s Revenge is a three ball 
	pattern closely related to Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge. The major difference 
	between the two tricks is the flourish,&nbsp;which is far less smooth in 
	Romeo&#39;s Revenge. Since it bears less resemblance to Mills Mess, 
	Romeo&#39;s Revenge is generally harder to learn than Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge, 
	therefore it is best that you are already familiar with the latter before 
	trying this trick.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn Romeo&#39;s Revenge, it is best to begin with the 
	flourish. Start with two balls, one in each hand, and arms crossed. Uncross 
	and recross your arms, then throw a ball vertically from your bottom hand 
	(which started out on top). Then, throw the ball in your other hand (on top) 
	and use that empty hand to claw catch the first ball. The second ball 
	should be thrown back towards the center of your body, and caught by your 
	bottom hand.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this flourish on both sides until it feels natural. 
	Then, all that&#39;s left it to add in the third ball. Start with your arms 
	crossed, two balls in your lower hand, one ball in your upper hand. Make a 
	vertical throw&nbsp; with a ball from your lower hand, and then execute the 
	flourish shown above, bringing the lower hand around and down on top of the 
	first ball thrown, which will be caught by the upper hand hand which makes 
	the first throw of the flourish. You will then complete the flourish by 
	throwing the last ball from your lower hand (now on top), claw catching the 
	second ball, and then catching the third ball with hand now on the bottom.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/romeosrevengerun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To do the full Romeo&#39;s Revenge, 
	you simply need to make another vertical throw before catching the last ball 
	of the flourish, and then simply repeat the flourish using the new vertical 
	ball. Work on doing one or two cycles at a time, and then add more as you 
	become more comfortable with the pattern. As in Rubenstein&#39;s&nbsp; Revenge, 
	each ball has its own unique path, so balls travelling differently each 
	cycle is a sign that something is wrong.</p>
