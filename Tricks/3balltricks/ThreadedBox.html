	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Threaded Box is a variation 
	of the Box in which each vertical throw is caught under-the-arm, with that 
	top arm weaving through the pattern. This creates a much more fluid juggling 
	trick than the normal Box, while also increasing the difficulty by rasing 
	the likelihood of collision. The Threaded Box is generally juggled at a 
	greater height than the regular Box, therefore is is also a fair amount 
	slower.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Threaded Box, start with one ball in each hand. 
	Bring your non-dominant hand over to the dominant side of your body while 
	also shifting your dominant hand farther from the center of your body (so 
	your arms aren&#39;t crossed). Raise your dominant hand up about six inches, and 
	then make a vertical throw from your non-dominant hand. Simultaneously, make 
	a horizontal pass from your dominant hand to your non-dominant hand. The 
	pass should be timed such that it goes under the vertical ball. As your 
	non-dominant hand catches the pass, you are going to pull it back to the 
	non-dominant side of your body, at a distance away from the center that 
	matches the distance from the center that your dominant hand was before the 
	pass. Your dominant hand should then be crossed over to the non-dominant 
	side of your body (essentially your hands are mirroring the position they 
	were in at the start). As the vertical ball first thrown begins to descend, 
	make a horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand while simultaneously 
	bringing your dominant hand up to receive it near the center of your body. 
	Your non-dominant hand will then cross underneath your dominant hand to 
	catch the vertical ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/threadedboxtwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the third 
	ball, you are going to start with two balls in your dominant hand and one 
	ball in your non-dominant. Bring your dominant hand over to your 
	non-dominant side and make a vertical throw. Then, bring your dominant hand 
	back over to your dominant side while also bringing your non-dominant hand 
	to your dominant side (your hands should now be in the same position as they 
	would be at the beginning of step one). As the first ball begins to descend, 
	make a second vertical throw, from your non-dominant hand this time, and 
	then make a horizontal pass from your dominant hand to your non-dominant 
	hand (just like you did in step one). Right after you make the pass, cross 
	your dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand and catch the first 
	ball. As you non-dominant hand catches the pass, bring the hand to the 
	outside of your body. Catch the second ball with your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/threadedboxthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this on both sides as shown in the 
	animation above.&nbsp; To run the full Threaded Box, simply make another 
	vertical throw/horizontal pass combination as the second vertical ball 
	begins to descend. This will mark the beginning of a second cycle, after 
	which you will simply keep repeating cycles on alternating sides. </p>
