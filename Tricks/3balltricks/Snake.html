	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Snake is a pattern in which 
	each hand takes a turn throwing all the balls in a row, as if juggling a 
	Five Ball Cascade. While it&#39;s fairly simple, the Snake can be tricky to 
	juggle due to its odd timing; you want to be just about throwing the last 
	ball from one hand while the first ball is being caught in the other.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best way to learn the Snake is to start with all three 
	balls in your dominant hand. Throw all three balls from your dominant hand 
	to your non-dominant hand such that the last one is being thrown as the 
	first one is being caught.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/snakerun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. Pay particular attention on the 
	timing of your throws. Once you are comfortable with one cycle of the Snake, 
	you can simply add more on by throwing each ball back across your body as 
	they are caught.</p>
