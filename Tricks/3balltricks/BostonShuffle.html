	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Boston Shuffle—also called 
	Slams—is a trick in which you make alternating slam throws through an 
	otherwise Cascade-like pattern. This trick can also be seen as a Shuffle 
	which is constantly switching directions. As such, the Boston Shuffle can 
	serve as practice for the Shuffle, but can also be learned more quickly if 
	you already know the Shuffle beforehand.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start learning the Boston Shuffle, you first need to be 
	able to do slam throws on each side. Hold one ball in each hand, and then 
	make a Cascade throw with your non-dominant hand. Then, raise your dominant 
	hand up over the thrown ball, and make a downward pass with the held ball, 
	catching it in your non-dominant hand, and then claw catch the first ball 
	with your dominant hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this slam throw on both sides until your are very 
	comfortable with it. To add in the third ball, start by juggling a normal 
	Cascade pattern. Then, make a slam throw with your dominant hand, throwing 
	the ball in your non-dominant hand as an overthrow to clear space for the 
	downward pass. After the pass is caught, resume juggling the Cascade.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bostonshufflethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides until you can perform it smoothly 
	and without major hesitation. The final step to learning the Boston Shuffle is 
	to chain one slam together with a slam from the opposite side. Start by 
	juggling a normal Cascade, then make a slam throw and overthrow like in the 
	previous step. However, instead of going back into the Cascade, you are 
	going to immediately make a single Cascade throw using the hand which had 
	just done a slam, and then perform another slam using your other hand. After 
	the last slam, return to the normal Cascade.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bostonshufflerun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have mastered two slams, try a third, fourth, fifth, 
	and so on until you are running the Boston Shuffle continuously. This pattern 
	is not particularly complicated, but the accuracy required for the slam 
	throws will take some time to acquire. If performed correctly, each ball 
	should travel along a single path (e.g. only one ball should ever be 
	slammed), so it may help to use easily distinguishable balls when 
	practicing.</p>
