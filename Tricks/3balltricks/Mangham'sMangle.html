	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mangham&#39;s Mangle is a three 
	ball pattern established by <a href="http://www.kingscascade.com">Matt Mangham</a>. 
	It uses claw catches paired with large, revolving arm motions to create a 
	fairly unique trick. The odd timing of the catches, combined with an overall 
	exaggeration of movement, makes Mangham&#39;s Mangle a fun trick to watch.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn Mangham&#39;s Mangle, start by juggling a normal 
	Cascade. After catching a ball with your dominant hand, raise it up a few 
	inches and cross your non-dominant hand underneath your dominant hand, 
	making a throw toward the center of your body. As you make that throw, swing 
	your dominant hand around and over the ball being thrown. As your dominant 
	hand comes back around, and as the thrown ball descends toward your 
	non-dominant hand (which should be at the center of your body ready to catch 
	the ball), make simultaneous throws from both your dominant hand, directed 
	toward the opposite side of your body, and your non-dominant hand, directed 
	from the center toward your dominant hand. With your dominant hand still up 
	in the air (make sure to exaggerate the effect), claw catch the ball thrown 
	from your non-dominant hand, while using that hand to catch the ball thrown 
	from your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/manghamsmanglethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To run the full 
	Mangham&#39;s Mangle, you just need to cut out all but one of the Cascade throws 
	that separates each cycle. As you are catching the two balls from the 
	simultaneous pair of throws, you are going to make a Cascade throw from your 
	non-dominant hand to clear space for the catch..This will then be followed 
	by the under-the-arm throw done at the beginning of the cycle shown in step 
	one. This is then of course followed by the exaggerated revolving arm motion 
	and simultaneous throws.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/manghamsmanglefull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final arm motion shown in the animation above marks the 
	beginning of the next cycle. Simply repeat the same throws and catches 
	(alternating hands and sides) and you will be juggling the full Mangham&#39;s 
	Mangle.</p>
