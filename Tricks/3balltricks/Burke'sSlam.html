	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burke&#39;s Slam is a variation of 
	the Boston Shuffle in which the slammed ball is carried around and over the 
	rest of the pattern, as if juggling Takeouts; the name &quot;Burke&#39;s Slam&quot; likely 
	arose due to the common confusion between Burke&#39;s Barrage and Takeouts. It 
	is important that you already have some experience with both the Boston 
	Shuffle and Takeouts before attempting Burke&#39;s Slam.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Burke&#39;s Slam, start with one ball in your 
	dominant hand and two balls in your non-dominant hand. Cross your hands such 
	that your dominant arm is over your non-dominant arm, then make a vertical 
	throw from your non-dominant hand. At the same time, you are going to 
	uncross your arms and swing your dominant hand up and over the thrown ball, 
	which should just be reaching its peak. As that ball begins to descend, you 
	are going to make a slam throw (diagonal pass) from your dominant hand down 
	to your non-dominant hand, clearing space for your dominant hand to 
	claw-catch the descending vertical ball. As the slam throw is being 
	performed, you are also going to throw the ball in your non-dominant hand 
	over the slammed ball and toward the dominant side of your body. This will 
	clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the slammed ball, after 
	which you will catch the last ball with your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/burkesslamthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To continue the 
	pattern, just make another vertical under-the-arm throw, this time with your 
	dominant hand, using the slammed ball. You will then make a slam throw from 
	your non-dominant hand, and the trick will continue on from there. Burke&#39;s 
	Slam is a very easy pattern to learn if you are already familiar with the 
	Boston Shuffle, and is quite fun to juggle. </p>
