	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Swap variation of the 
	Shower is essentially a normal Shower with an extra double pass made 
	underneath every high throw. This gives the pattern a more rushed feel, and 
	makes it harder to control. The Swap variation can also be thought of as a 
	synchronous version of the High-Low Shower, though it is a faster and 
	smaller pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Swap variation, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a high throw from your 
	dominant hand and then, as that ball reaches its peak, make a pass from 
	each hand simultaneously, raising your non-dominant hand up slightly to 
	avoid collision. After the two passes are completed, the high ball thrown 
	earlier should be descending toward your non-dominant hand. Make a second 
	high throw from your dominant hand paired with a horizontal pass from your 
	non-dominant hand, clearing space for your non-dominant hand to catch the 
	first ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/showerswapthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this step extensively. To run the full Swap 
	variation, simply perform another double pass underneath the second high 
	throw, followed by another throw/pass combination. The cycle then repeats. 
	The Swap variation of the Shower is not a particularly hard pattern, but the 
	quick double pass will take some time to master. </p>
