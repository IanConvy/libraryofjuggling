	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 441 Mills Mess is a 
	variation of Mills Mess done with the 441 siteswap, meaning each ball is 
	thrown and caught by the same hand, and a horizontal pass is done every two 
	throws. When performed properly, the 441 Mills Mess looks superficially 
	similar to the regular Mills Mess, except for the quick exchange of a ball 
	between hands.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the 441 Mills Mess, start with one ball in each 
	hand. Cross your dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand, and then 
	make a vertical throw from your dominant hand. As that ball reaches its 
	peak, make a vertical throw from your non-dominant hand, and then uncross 
	and recross your arms in the opposite configuration, catching the first ball 
	with your dominant hand, now on top, and the second ball with your 
	non-dominant hand. Notice that the balls did not switch hands.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/441millsmesstwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the third 
	ball, you are going to start with two balls in your dominant hand and one 
	ball in your non-dominant. Cross your dominant hand underneath your 
	non-dominant hand, and then make a vertical throw from your dominant hand 
	followed by a vertical throw from your non-dominant hand (as done in the 
	previous step). As you uncross your arms, make a horizontal pass from your 
	dominant hand to your non-dominant hand, and then recross your arms and 
	catch the two vertical balls in the same manner as the previous step.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/441millsmessthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To run the full 441 
	Mills Mess, simply make another vertical throw as the second ball approaches 
	your non-dominant hand. That will clear space for you to catch the second 
	ball, which will then be used for the horizontal pass after you make another 
	vertical throw from your dominant hand. The 441 Mills Mess looks best when 
	the vertical throws mirror the throws done in the normal Mills Mess, so make 
	sure to angle the vertical throws toward the center of your body. </p>
