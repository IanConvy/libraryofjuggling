	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom&#39;s Trick (unofficial name) 
	is a three ball pattern established by Thomas Wood. It is essentially the 
	Boston Shuffle with a chop inserted before each slam. The pattern gained a 
	bit of infamy after being touted as &quot;mathematically impossible,&quot; though this 
	claim was easily debunked by Nathan Peterson in his
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uIcc6O7irU">tutorial video </a>
	(note that his asymetric interpretation is slightly different than my own, 
	since I am referencing a more direct demonstration posted by Woods after 
	Peterson had solved the trick). Ironically this &quot;mathematically impossible&quot; 
	trick is actually a fairly easy three ball pattern, as long as you are 
	already comfortable with Chops and the Boston Shuffle.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Tom&#39;s Trick, start with two balls in your 
	non-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant. Raise your dominant arm up 
	and shift your non-dominant hand to the center of your body. Perform a chop 
	with your dominant hand while simultaneously making a fairly vertical 
	under-the-arm throw along the dominant side of your body with your 
	non-dominant hand. As that ball reaches its peak and begins to descend your 
	dominant hand should be finishing its chop. Once that arm motion is finished 
	you are going to make a throw from your dominant hand toward the 
	non-dominant side of your body, clearing space for your dominant hand to 
	catch the under-the-arm throw. Your non-dominant hand will then perform a 
	slam throw to your dominant hand, claw catching the ball your dominant hand 
	just threw.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/tomstrickthree.gif" width="404" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. For the next step you 
	are going to make a throw from your dominant hand toward the non-dominant 
	side of your body before catching the slammed ball (instead of simply 
	catching and holding both balls as done in the previous step). As that ball 
	crosses through the center of your body, make a normal Cascade-style throw 
	from your non-dominant hand toward your dominant hand. After that throw you 
	are going to raise your non-dominant hand up and grab out of the air the 
	ball that had been thrown by your dominant hand. You will then perform a 
	chop with your non-dominant hand while simultaneously making an 
	under-the-arm throw with your dominant hand, clearing space for that hand to 
	catch the Cascade throw previously made by your non-dominant hand. The 
	under-the-arm throw will be caught by your non-dominant hand after the chop 
	is completed.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="486" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/tomstrickfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. Notice how the final 
	under-the-arm throw and chop are a mirror image of how you started. To 
	continue the pattern simply repeat the step using the opposite hand 
	configuration. Overall Tom&#39;s Trick is a relatively easy pattern to master 
	while being surprisingly enjoyable to juggle.</p>
