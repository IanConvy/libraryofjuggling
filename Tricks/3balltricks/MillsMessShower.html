	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mills Mess Shower is a 
	variation of Mills Mess in which a horizontal pass is cleanly inserted into 
	the pattern. This creates a slightly quicker and more complex trick without 
	much added difficulty. Obviously, it is important that you 
	already be reasonably comfortable with both Mills Mess and the Shower before 
	attempting this pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Mills Mess Shower, start with two balls 
	in your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your dominant 
	hand over your non-dominant hand and then make a throw from your dominant 
	hand toward the center of your body (as if doing the first throw of Mills 
	Mess). As you make that throw, uncross your arms. As the first ball begins 
	to descend towards your dominant hand (the same hand that threw it), you are 
	going to make a throw from your non-dominant hand along the same arc as the 
	first throw. You will then make a horizontal pass from your dominant hand to 
	your now empty non-dominant hand, clearing space for your dominant hand to 
	catch the first ball. Your non-dominant hand will then throw the 
	horizontally passed ball along the same arc as the first two balls. 
	While making this throw, you are going to cross your non-dominant hand over 
	your dominant hand, catching the second ball in your non-dominant hand. Your 
	dominant hand will then make an under-the-arm throw toward the center of 
	your body, clearing space for it to catch the third ball. The ball just 
	thrown will then be caught by your non-dominant hand, which should still be 
	crossed over your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/millsmessshowerfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. You have just 
	completed one cycle of the Mills Mess Shower on each side of your body. To 
	connect the two cycles together, simply make an over-the-arm throw from your 
	non-dominant hand (which will be crossed on top of your dominant hand at the 
	end of the first cycle) and repeat the same throws on the other side of of 
	your body. Just keep juggling in the rhythm of Mills Mess and you will have 
	trick down pretty quickly.</p>
