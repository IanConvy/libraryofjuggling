	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relf&#39;s Revenge is a three ball 
	pattern which adds fast orbits to the basic 423 siteswap. It can also be 
	thought of as a variation of the Follow in which an orbit is performed 
	before each carry. For this reason it&#39;s important that you already be 
	comfortable with the Follow before attempting Relf&#39;s Revenge, and it also 
	probably wouldn&#39;t hurt to know the Weave (another 423 trick).<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Relf&#39;s Revenge, start with two balls in 
	your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Raise your 
	non-dominant hand up to about shoulder height, and then bring both hands to 
	the center of your body such that your dominant hand is positioned under 
	your non-dominant hand. Then make an under-the-arm throw from your dominant 
	hand back toward the dominant side of your body while simultaneously 
	swinging your non-dominant hand in a circle around and then under the thrown ball. 
	As that ball peaks and begins to descend you will follow it from above with 
	your non-dominant hand, which should have finished circling around. Your 
	dominant hand will then make a second under-the-arm throw from the same 
	position as the first, though the throw itself should be more 
	vertical. This will clear space for your dominant hand to catch the first 
	ball, after which you will catch the second ball with your non-dominant 
	hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="448" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsrevengethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. For the next step we 
	are going to focus on what happens to your dominant hand after catching the 
	first ball. Your non-dominant hand, having been following the first ball, 
	will slide down along the inside of your dominant hand, which will in turn 
	begin to shift up and around such that it ends up close to the center of your body 
	at about shoulder height. At this point the second ball (the last throw you 
	made in first step) will be descending, so you will make an under-the-arm 
	throw from your non-dominant hand back toward the non-dominant side of your 
	body before catching the second ball with your non-dominant hand. As this 
	third throw is being made your dominant hand will swing around and then 
	under the thrown ball. After that ball peaks and begins to descend you will 
	catch it with your non-dominant hand while following it from above with your dominant 
	hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="448" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsrevengefull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this on both sides. Notice how the arm 
	motion you did with your dominant hand is a mirror image of the one you did 
	at the beginning with your non-dominant hand. To continue the pattern simply 
	make a second under-the-arm throw with your non-dominant hand and then use 
	it catch the ball being followed by your dominant hand. This will set you up 
	to repeat the circular arm flourish with your non-dominant hand, at which 
	point you are right back where you started. Relf&#39;s Revenge is not an 
	especially hard pattern, but its rarity will make the trick more impressive 
	to other jugglers. </p>
