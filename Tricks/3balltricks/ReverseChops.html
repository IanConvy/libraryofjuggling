	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reverse Chops is a variation of 
	of the standard Chops pattern in which the balls are carried up and out of 
	the pattern from the center, as opposed to down from the outside in. Despite 
	the opposing directions, Chops and Reverse Chops feel fairly similar to 
	juggle, therefore, assuming you already know Chops, this pattern should not 
	be that difficult to learn.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start by juggling a normal Cascade. Then, reach over with 
	your non-dominant hand and make a roughly vertical throw underneath your 
	dominant arm (similar to normal Chops). At the same time, take your dominant 
	hand (which is holding a ball), and bring it up and over the the ball just 
	thrown. Circle the arm back and continue juggling a normal Cascade.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/reversechopsthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this carry on both sides. Once your are comfortable 
	with it, try doing the carry continuously on one side.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/reversechopsrun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you can do continuous Reverse Chops with each side 
	isolated, it is only a matter of combining them together and you will be 
	juggling the full pattern. It is best to just do two or three carries in a 
	row to start with, and then add more in as you become comfortable with the 
	trick.</p>
