	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Burst Box (unofficial name) 
	is essentially a symmetrical variation of the Broken Box. For each side, a 
	single cycle of the Broken Box is juggled, with a quick transition using the 
	normal Box done in the middle. The Burst Box is not significantly harder 
	than the Broken Box, but it is more dynamic and interesting to watch. Before 
	learning the Burst Box, it is <strong>very</strong> important that you be 
	able to juggle the Broken Box on both sides of your body. Once you have 
	achieved that level of proficiency, this pattern will be very easy.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Burst Box, start with two balls in your dominant 
	hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a vertical throw from your 
	dominant hand and then follow it up with the vertical throw/horizontal pass 
	combination normally done in the Broken Box. Finish the cycle by making a vertical 
	throw from your non-dominant hand and a horizontal pass from your dominant 
	hand. If you were doing the Broken Box, you would repeat the cycle again. 
	For the Burst Box however, you are going to make another vertical throw from 
	your non-dominant hand (on the other side of your body this time since the 
	hand is now uncrossed) paired with another horizontal pass from your dominant 
	hand. You will then make a third vertical throw from your non-dominant hand 
	closer to the center of your body, along with a third horizontal pass from 
	your dominant hand. This will lead you into another cycle of the Broken Box, 
	this time on the opposite side of your body. After that cycle is finished, 
	catch all the balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/burstboxfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To run the full Burst 
	Box, just make another normal Box throw/pass combination and do a third 
	Broken Box cycle, followed by a fourth on the opposite side, and so on. </p>
