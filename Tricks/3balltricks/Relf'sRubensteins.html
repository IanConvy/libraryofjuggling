	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relf&#39;s Rubensteins is a three 
	ball pattern which, as its strange name might suggest, can be thought of as 
	a combination of Relf&#39;s Revenge and Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge. However, I think 
	the trick can be better conceptualized as Romeo&#39;s Revenge spliced onto the 
	end of Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge, as the last throw and arm flourish are 
	essentially identical to Romeo&#39;s Revenge, while bearing a much weaker 
	resemblance to Relf&#39;s Revenge. With this in mind, it would be wise for you 
	to already be comfortable with Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge and Romeo&#39;s Revenge 
	before attempting this pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Relf&#39;s Rubensteins, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Cross your dominant 
	hand underneath your non-dominant hand, and then make a vertical 
	under-the-arm throw from dominant hand. As you do this you are also going to 
	begin uncrossing and then recrossing your arms The first ball should be 
	descending just as you complete the recrossing, so you will then make an 
	under-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand back toward the non-dominant 
	side of your body, clearing space for your non-dominant hand to catch the 
	first ball. You will then swing your dominant hand (which should at this 
	point be crossed over your non-dominant hand) under, around, and then above 
	the thrown ball. So far this has all been identical to Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge. 
	However, instead of claw catching the ball in the air you are going to 
	follow it with your dominant hand as the ball descends. You will then make a 
	second under-the-arm throw—vertical this time—from your non-dominant hand, 
	clearing space for the hand to catch the first ball it threw (the ball your 
	dominant hand is following). You will then catch the last ball with your 
	dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsrubensteinsthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. The ending of the step above 
	should feel very similar to Romeo&#39;s Revenge, and so for the next step you 
	are going to directly transition into Romeo&#39;s Revenge by making a throw from 
	your dominant hand (the hand that was following the ball) toward the center 
	of your body and then claw-catching the ball just thrown under-the-arm by 
	your non-dominant hand. You will then continue the downward motion of the 
	claw catch and recross your dominant hand over your non-dominant hand. As 
	the ball thrown by your dominant hand begins to descend you will make 
	another vertical under-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand, clearing 
	space for it to catch the descending ball. You will then catch the last ball 
	with your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsrubensteinsfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, practice this on both sides. Notice how the last 
	throw is a mirror image of the first throw—to continue the pattern, simply 
	uncross and recross your hands as if juggling Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge and then 
	repeat the same throws and catches you did before, except with your hands 
	reversed. Relf&#39;s Rubensteins is a very graceful pattern when preformed 
	smoothly, and its rarity makes the trick surprising even for other jugglers. </p>
