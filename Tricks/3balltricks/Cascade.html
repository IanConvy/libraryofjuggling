	<p id="description" ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Three Ball Cascade is the most 
	basic juggling pattern, and the first trick any would-be juggler should 
	learn. The Cascade is generally considered to be the easiest pattern, and 
	forms the backbone of many other tricks. <br />
	<br />
	<img alt=""  height="178" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/oneball_50000.gif" style="float: right" width="192" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the pattern, it is important to make sure you are 
	comfortable with throwing and catching a ball. It sounds silly, I know, but 
	when first starting to juggle I found that my left hand (non-dominant) had a 
	hard time accurately throwing the ball to my right. You will want to get 
	very comfortable throwing the ball from you dominant hand to your 
	non-dominant, and vice versa. Try to keep the height of the throws a little 
	bit above your head. Once you have mastered this, you are ready to move on 
	to the next step.<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	It is at this second step that most jugglers begin dropping (short hand way 
	to say that you have failed to catch your ball) a lot. As such, this is 
	probably a good time to remind you that using tennis balls on a hard floor 
	is not the best way to juggle. For beginners, I would highly recommend 
	getting some good quality bean bags
	<a href="http://www.dube.com/beanbag/4-panel-juggling-beanbags.php">such as 
	these ones from Dube</a>. They are soft, don&#39;t bounce or roll (much), and 
	are quite easy to catch.<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that you have the proper juggling equipment, it is 
	time to add in the second ball. This second ball is going to travel through 
	the air with a similar trajectory as the first ball, except it is going to 
	be thrown underneath that first ball, and travel in a different direction.<br />
	<img alt=""  height="168" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/twoballcascade.gif" width="168" class="smallanim" /><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	To start, hold a ball in each hand, and then throw one ball up in the same 
	trajectory as step one. As that ball reaches it peak, you are going to throw 
	the second ball up underneath it towards your other hand (the one that threw 
	the first ball), then catch them both. You are going to want to make sure 
	that you practice throwing the first ball from both hands. If that description confuses you, 
	just focus on the animation above and try to copy its throws. This pattern 
	is known as the Two Ball Cascade.<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You 
	must make sure not to pass the second ball horizontally to your other hand 
	(shown below), 
	as this is the way people often intuitively try and juggle two balls.<img alt=""  height="136" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/incorrect.gif" width="156" class="smallanim" /><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you are able to juggle two balls correctly without 
	much trouble, you are ready to add in the third ball. The first pattern to 
	learn with three balls is the flash, where every ball is thrown up and then 
	caught again like so.<br />
	<img alt=""  height="168" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/3ballflash.gif" width="167" class="smallanim" /><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The flash is very similar to the Two Ball Cascade, except you sneak in a 
	third toss during the pause that occurs after you throw the first two balls. 
	While the timing of this trick is slightly different than the standard Three 
	Ball Cascade (notice there is still a period of time where all three balls 
	are in the air), practicing the flash will improve your accuracy and throw 
	speed. Once you can do the Three Ball Flash reliably without too many drops, 
	you are ready to move onto the final step.<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the final step in learning the Three Ball Cascade, 
	you will be combining all the skills learned thus far. Starting with three 
	balls (two in your dominant hand), you are going two throw your first ball, 
	and wait for it to reach its peak. Then you will throw the ball in your 
	non-dominant hand, allowing for the first ball to land in your now empty 
	hand. Once that second ball reaches its peak, you will throw the third ball 
	from your dominant hand, clearing room for the second ball to be caught. And 
	so the cycle continues, each time a ball reaches its peak, another one is 
	thrown, freeing up a hand to catch the first ball. The animation below shows 
	the pattern being run for five throws and catches.<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Now that you have the basic pattern down, the only thing you have left to do 
	is practice, practice, practice! When it comes down to it, that&#39;s all 
	juggling is. No one is born good at juggling, the experts work hard for the 
	talent they posses, and anybody can become as good with enough dedication 
	and work. After practicing the Three Ball Cascade, you should see your 
	throws becoming more accurate, your arm movements less noticeable, and the 
	height required for you to run the pattern will decrease.<br />

	<p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Congratulations, you are now an official juggler. But 
	this is just the beginning, there are still countless more patterns out 
	there for you to try. Browse through the Library of Juggling to find some 
	cool new tricks to learn. For a beginner, I would recommend
