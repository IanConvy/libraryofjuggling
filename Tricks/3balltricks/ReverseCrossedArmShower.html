	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reverse Crossed-Arm Shower 
	is a variation of the Shower in which the pattern is juggled with your arms 
	crossed. Unlike the standard Crossed-Arm Shower, the Reverse variation has 
	horizontal passes made from the hand crossed <em>under</em>, rather than the 
	hand on top. Such labeling is ultimately arbitrary, as I could have just as 
	easily made this form the standard variation. Naming aside, the Reverse 
	Crossed-Arm Shower can be learned by taking the
	<a href="CrossedArmShower.html">standard Crossed-Arm Shower tutorial</a> and 
	simply crossing your dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand, so 
	that you are making horizontal passes from the below instead of above. </p>
