	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gilligan&#39;s Box is an odd 
	variation of the Box that combines portions of the Burst Box with an 
	additional vertical throw that is not paired with any horizontal pass. This 
	gives the pattern a more relaxed cadence, while also offering more variety 
	to the normally rigid Box siteswap. Because this trick includes parts of the 
	Burst Box, it helps to already know the Broken or Burst Box patterns before 
	attempting Gilligan&#39;s Box, though this is not required.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn Gilligan&#39;s Box, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a fountain-style 
	(where the ball travels in a circle rather than along a single vertical 
	column) throw from your dominant hand, and then follow it up with a second 
	fountain throw from your dominant hand paired with a horizontal pass from 
	your non-dominant hand to your dominant hand. As that pass is being made, 
	cross your non-dominant hand underneath your dominant hand, and then use it 
	to catch the first fountain throw. At this point, the second fountain ball 
	should be descending toward your dominant hand. To clear space for the 
	catch, make a fountain throw from your dominant hand, while also 
	simultaneously uncrossing your non-dominant hand. Catch the second fountain 
	throw in your now empty dominant hand, and then catch the third fountain 
	throw in your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/gilligansboxthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To run the full Gilligan&#39;s Box, 
	simply make a fountain throw from your non-dominant hand, after it 
	uncrosses, paired with a horizontal pass from your dominant hand. This will 
	set you up for a new cycle on the opposite side of your body. </p>
