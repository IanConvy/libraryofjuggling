	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Three In One is a three 
	ball pattern in which all three balls are thrown and caught by the same 
	hand. The balls travel from the center of your body to the outside of your 
	body in a continuous circuit, identical to that seen in the Fountain. In 
	fact, the Three In One can be seen as simply half of the Six Ball Fountain.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Three In One, it is best to start with just two 
	balls. Hold both balls in your dominant hand, and then make two quick 
	vertical throws angled slightly toward the outside of your body. The throws 
	should be done in quick enough succession that your dominant hand should 
	temporarily be empty. You will then catch each ball and throw it back up 
	with the same timing.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/threeinonetwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice these two throws until your can perform them 
	smoothly and consistently. To add in the thirds ball, you are going to
	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mccaughan/4440307295/">hold all three 
	balls</a> in your dominant hand and then make the same two throws as you did 
	in the previous step. This time however, you will still have one ball left, 
	and it will be thrown right as the first ball approaches your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/threeinonethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this extensively. Once you can make all three throws 
	and catches in a controlled manner, you simply need to keep adding in more 
	and more throws and you will be juggling the Three In One.</p>
