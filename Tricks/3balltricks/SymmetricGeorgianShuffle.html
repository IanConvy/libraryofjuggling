	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Symmetric Georgian Shuffle 
	is, as it sounds, a symmetrical variation of the Georgian Shuffle. Instead 
	of making a fake toss with one of your hands (as done in the original 
	Georgian Shuffle), you make an actual throw, under which you perform the 
	multiplex. Beyond that, the two Georgian Shuffles are pretty similar, except 
	the inside multiplexed ball is grabbed by the hand that didn&#39;t throw it 
	(i.e. the hand that made the first throw) in the symmetrical variation.
	<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before attempting the Symmetric Georgian Shuffle, it is 
	important that you already be able to juggle the normal Georgian Shuffle on 
	both sides of your body (i.e. you are able to juggle the pattern with either 
	hand making the multiplex). To begin learning the Symmetric Georgian 
	Shuffle, start with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your 
	non-dominant. Make a normal Cascade-style throw from your non-dominant hand, 
	and then cross your dominant hand to the non-dominant side of your body 
	(your non-dominant hand can either be brought to the outside or up against 
	your chest to move it out of the way). Make a split-multiplex throw from 
	your dominant hand, and then catch the Cascade throw with your now empty 
	dominant hand. As the multiplexed balls reach their peak, pluck the inside 
	ball out of the air using your non-dominant hand, and then cross your 
	dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand to catch the outside ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/symgeorgianshufflethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To add in the final throw, run 
	through the same throws and catches made in the previous step, but add in an 
	under-the-arm vertical throw along the outside of the outer multiplexed ball 
	using your dominant hand, which will then catch the multiplexed ball. As 
	that outside vertical throw begins to descend, take your non-dominant hand, 
	which should have just grabbed the inside multiplexed ball, and swing it 
	over and around the outside ball, catching it as the ball descends.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/symgeorgianshufflefull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this step on both sides. You have just 
	completed one cycle of the Symmetric Georgian Shuffle. To run the full 
	pattern, simply make another Cascade-style throw (with your opposite hand 
	this time) slightly before the outside vertical throw is caught by your 
	other hand. This will set you up to make another multiplex throw, after 
	which the cycle simply continues. </p>
