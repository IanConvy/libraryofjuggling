	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Broken Box is a shape 
	distortion of the regular Box pattern in which both vertical throws are made 
	on the same side of your body, forcing one of your arms to cross and uncross 
	each cycle. This makes the horizontal pass more difficult, since you need to 
	move your receiving hand into position while the ball is in the air. The 
	difficulty of the pass, combined with cramped vertical throws, makes the 
	Broken Box a fairly hard variation to master.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Broken Box, start with one ball in each hand. 
	Make a vertical throw from your dominant hand coupled with a horizontal pass 
	from your non-dominant hand, just like in the regular Box. However, as you 
	are throwing the horizontal pass, continue the motion of your arm so that it 
	crossed underneath your dominant hand. At this moment, the vertical ball 
	should be at its peak, and your non-dominant hand should be crossed 
	underneath your dominant hand. As the vertical ball begins to descend back 
	toward your dominant hand, make a horizontal pass from your dominant hand 
	while simultaneously uncrossing your non-dominant hand to receive the ball. 
	This pass should clear space for your dominant hand to catch the vertical 
	ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/brokenboxtwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until you can make the vertical throw and 
	horizontal passes consistently. To add in the third ball, start with two 
	balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a 
	vertical throw from your dominant hand at the very outside of your body, and 
	then follow it up with a second vertical throw from your dominant hand, this 
	time closer to the center of your body. Simultaneously, make a horizontal 
	pass from your non-dominant hand, just like you did in the previous step. 
	After you make the horizontal pass, cross your non-dominant hand underneath 
	your dominant arm and catch the first vertical throw. Catch the second 
	vertical throw with your dominant hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While practicing these throws, it may help to raise your 
	dominant hand up several inches to allow your non-dominant hand to cross 
	underneath more easily (as shown in the animation above). Once you have 
	these throws mastered, you will be ready for the final step. As the second 
	vertical ball approaches your dominant hand, as it does at the end of the 
	previous step, you are going to make a third vertical throw, from your 
	non-dominant hand, and then make a horizontal pass from your dominant hand 
	to your non-dominant hand, which will have to quickly uncross and return to 
	the other side of your body to receive the ball. The pass will clear space 
	for your dominant hand to catch the second vertical throw.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/brokenboxfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this single cycle extensively. To run the full 
	Broken Box, just make another vertical throw from your dominant hand paired 
	with a horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand, and then cross your 
	non-dominant hand under your dominant hand to catch the last vertical throw 
	from the previous cycle. </p>
