	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matt&#39;s Mess, also referred to 
	as the Simultaneous Mills Mess, is a variation of the Crossunder pattern in 
	which the center ball is thrown from the outside and travels between the two 
	vertical balls before being caught in the middle. Essentially it is a fusion 
	of the Crossunder and Reverse Infinity, so before attempting Matt&#39;s Mess it 
	is important that you already be comfortable with both of these patterns.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning learning Matt&#39;s Mess, start with two balls 
	in your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Cross your 
	arms and make the same pair of throws you would normally perform in the 
	Crossunder and then, as those balls begin to descend and your arms uncross, 
	throw the third ball such that it will travel from the outside to the middle 
	of your body. Catch the two vertical balls and then make another set of 
	crossed-arm throws (in the opposite configuration). The center ball should 
	travel between these balls and then be caught as you uncross your arms by 
	the hand that was crossed <em>under</em> your other hand (just like in the 
	regular Crossunder). You will then catch the two vertical balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/mattsmessthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. This is pretty much 
	the only intermediate step you really need to practice. To run the full 
	pattern simply make another outside-to-middle throw with the center ball and 
	follow it up with a set of crossed-arm vertical throws. To get the greatest 
	effect out of Matt&#39;s Mess you will want to juggle it low and compact, close 
	to the size of your regular Mills Mess pattern. </p>
