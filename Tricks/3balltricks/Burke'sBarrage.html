	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burke&#39;s Barrage is a three ball 
	trick established by Ken Burke which looks like a Mills Mess with one ball 
	carried through the pattern in a circular motion. It is one of the many 423 
	tricks, and is especially similar to Takeouts (the two tricks are often 
	confused with each other). However, compared to Takeouts, Burke&#39;s Barrage 
	benefits more from speed than size, and is best performed at a height 
	similar to Mills Mess. For this reason, Burke&#39;s Barrage is slightly more 
	difficult than Takeouts, therefore the latter trick should be learned before 
	trying this pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start learning Burke&#39;s Barrage, juggle a normal Takeouts 
	pattern, but try carrying your hand between the two center balls, instead of 
	over them.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/burkesbarragetake.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until your are comfortable with the 
	motion. After that, the only thing left is to practice making the two throws 
	look like their part of a Mills Mess. This is done by throwing the balls 
	across your body instead of in vertical columnsâ€”though the trick can still 
	be performed with columns throws if you so desire. If you are having trouble 
	getting these throws to look good, it might help to practice the Fake Mess, 
	another 423 pattern that also mimics a Mills Mess.</p>
