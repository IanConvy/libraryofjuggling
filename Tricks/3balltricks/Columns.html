	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Columns is usually the first synchronous (balls thrown 
	from both hands at the same time) pattern a juggler learns. It gets its name 
	from the vertical path travelled by each ball, similar to the columns used 
	in architecture. Like the overthrow patterns, Columns is a fairly easy trick 
	to learn.<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Breaking the trick down, we can see that Columns is really just a Two-in-One 
	in one hand with a third ball thrown synchronously from the other hand. 
	<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Knowing this, it would be important to make sure you can juggle the 
	columns-style Two-in-One, where the balls travel vertically in their own 
	separate paths:<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	One you have that down, all that&#39;s left is to add in the third ball (and 
	second hand). Starting with the Two-in-One, you are going to wait until you 
	are about throw your outside Two-in-One ball (the one that isn&#39;t at the 
	center of your body). As you are making that throw, you are also going to 
	throw the third ball up at the same time:<br />

	Once you can do a single synchronous throw reliably, you can begin cutting 
	down on the number of &quot;recovery throws&quot; you make, and move towards doing 
	constant synchronous throws. Once you have the basic Columns pattern down, 
	there are countless variations that can add extra complexity and visual 
	flair.</p>
