	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Box variation of the 
	Columns pattern is a little trick I came up while trying out variations on 
	the standard patternâ€”though the trick itself has been performed by others 
	before me. The pattern is exactly as it sounds: a fusion of 
	the Box and Columns. There is not all that much to this trick, and 
	thus a tutorial is not really necessary. As long as you are comfortable with 
	Columns and a basic pattern with a horizontal pass (i.e. 441), then you 
	should not have much trouble learning this pattern. </p>
