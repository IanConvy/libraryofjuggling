	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David&#39;s Dilemma is a simple yet 
	difficult trick established by David Thomas. It is essentially a two 
	ball Shower performed with one hand throwing a third ball vertically to make 
	space for the Shower catches. While the pattern itself is fundamentally 
	basic, the timing and relative heights of the throws make David&#39;s Dilemma a 
	challenge to juggle.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn David&#39;s Dilemma, start with one ball in each hand. 
	Make a high throw from your dominant hand toward your other hand while 
	simultaneously making a much lower vertical throw with your non-dominant 
	hand. If timed correctly, the vertical ball should land in your non-dominant 
	hand slightly ahead of your high throw. Make a second vertical throw from 
	your non-dominant hand and catch that first ball. Then, quickly make a 
	horizontal pass with that ball to your dominant hand, and then catch the 
	vertical ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/davidsdilemmatwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this extensively, paying close attention to the 
	timing and heights of your throws. Once you are comfortable with this step, 
	it is time to add in the third ball. Start with two balls in your dominant 
	hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make the same simultaneous 
	high/vertical throws as in the first step, and then follow it up with a 
	second pair once the first high throw approaches your non-dominant hand. 
	After catching that high throw, make a horizontal pass to your dominant hand 
	and then catch all the balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/davidsdilemmarun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#39;s all there is to David&#39;s Dilemma. In order to run 
	the full pattern, just keep throwing high/low pairs along with horizontal 
	passes. The timing will likely feel weird at first, but eventually you will 
	get used to it.
