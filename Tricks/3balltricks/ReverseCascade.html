	<p id="description">The Reverse Cascade is the pinnacle of overthrow skill, 
	a trick in which you must make every throw an overthrow. The trick gets its name from 
	being identical to the Cascade in every respect except for the throws, 
	which have been &quot;reversed.&quot;<br />
	<br />
	For the sake of this tutorial, I am going to assume you can already juggle a 
	solid (term for steady and accurate performance of a pattern) Half-Shower 
	and Juggler&#39;s Tennis. Learning these tricks will get you very used to doing 
	overthrows, which is important since the Reverse Cascade leaves little room 
	for error. To begin practicing the trick, start with a normal Cascade, and 
	then throw two overthrows in series—one from the left hand, one from the 
	right hand—and go back into the regular Cascade.<br />

	Once you have two overthrows down, you can start adding in a third, then a 
	fourth, and so on. The idea is to add one throw, practice, then add another and 
	practice. Eventually you will get to the point where you can keep making 
	overthrows one after the other indefinitely. Expect this trick to be harder 
	to learn than Juggler&#39;s Tennis or the Half-Shower.</p>
