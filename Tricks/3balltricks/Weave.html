	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Weave is a variation of the 
	423 in which a ball is carried through pattern by the hand that would 
	otherwise remain stationary. This motion can, if performed skillfully, make 
	the Weave one of the most graceful and elegant three ball patterns.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Weave, start with two balls in your 
	non-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant. Cross your non-dominant 
	hand over to the dominant side of your body, and then position your dominant 
	hand above your non-dominant hand such that your arm is bent upward. Make a 
	throw from your non-dominant hand back toward the non-dominant side of your 
	body while simultaneously swinging your dominant hand up and over toward the 
	center of your body. The thrown ball should pass along the outside of your 
	dominant hand, which will in turn move underneath the ball and then swing 
	back down to its normal Cascade position (the overall path of the hand 
	should be an &quot;S&quot; shape). As your dominant hand is completing its motion, the 
	thrown ball will be approaching your non-dominant hand, which should have 
	shifted back over to the non-dominant side of your body. Make a relatively 
	short throw from your non-dominant hand toward the dominant side of your 
	body, clearing space for the first ball to be caught. The ball just thrown 
	from your non-dominant hand will then be caught by your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/weavethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this step on both sides. You will want to 
	be very comfortable with the arm flourish, as it forms the backbone of the 
	pattern. Next, you are going to perform all the throws, catches, and 
	movements of the previous step, but instead of stopping after the second 
	throw from your non-dominant hand you are instead going to raise your 
	non-dominant hand up and catch the first ball a little higher than normal. 
	You will then continue this vertical motion as your dominant hand crosses 
	over to the non-dominant side of your body. At this point your non-dominant 
	hand should be positioned above your dominant hand, mirroring the position 
	you first started in. You will then perform the first step again, this time 
	using the opposite hands.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="798" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/weavefull.gif" width="624" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&#39;ve now completed two cycles of the Weave. To 
	perform the full pattern, simply keep doing cycles on alternating sides of 
	your body. The Weave is a very cool trick in its own right, but it can also 
	serve as a foundation for a wide number of variations, mostly by altering 
	the shape of the arm flourish. </p>
