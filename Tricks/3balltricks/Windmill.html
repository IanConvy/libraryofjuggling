	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Windmill—also known as the 
	False Shower—is a three ball trick in which the balls travel in a circular 
	pattern, being thrown from one side and caught on the other. As you can see 
	from the siteswap (3), the Windmill is actually just an incredibly distorted 
	Cascade, with the balls being thrown between hands. The arm movements of the 
	Windmill are also very similar to Mills Mess, such that knowing Mills Mess 
	makes it very easy to learn the Windmill. This tutorial however will assume 
	you do not already know the Mills Mess pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Windmill, start with two balls in your 
	non-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant. Cross your arms such that 
	your non-dominant hand is on top. Then, make a throw from your non-dominant 
	hand toward the center of your body, and uncross your arms. After your arms 
	have completely uncrossed, make a throw from your dominant hand in the same 
	direction as the first ball. Then, recross your arms such that your dominant 
	hand is on top, and then catch the first ball with your dominant hand. As 
	the second ball begins descending, throw the last ball from your 
	non-dominant hand under your dominant arm and then catch the second ball 
	with your non-dominant hand. Finally, catch the third ball with your 
	dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/windmillthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until your are comfortable with those three 
	throws. Next, we are going to add in an additional two throws. The previous 
	step leaves off with your dominant arm crossed over your non-dominant arm. 
	To add in the two throws, you are going to uncross your arms (while the 
	third throw is still in the air) and make a fourth throw going the same 
	direction. You will then recross your arms with your dominant arm staying on 
	top, and catch the third throw with your dominant hand. As the fourth throw 
	begins its descent, you will make a fifth throw with your non-dominant hand 
	under your dominant arm (this is identical to the last throw of the previous 
	step) and then uncross your arms to catch the fourth ball. Then catch the 
	fifth ball with your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/windmillrun.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#39;s all there is to the Windmill. To run the full 
	pattern, just keep making those alternating fourth and fifth throws, and 
	make sure that only one hand is ever on top when your arms are crossed. The 
	Windmill can also be juggled in the other direction, with the opposite hand 
	on top. </p>
