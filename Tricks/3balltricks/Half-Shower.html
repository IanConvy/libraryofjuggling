	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Half-Shower is one of the first asymmetrical (one 
	hand does one thing and the other other hand does something else) patterns 
	jugglers learn. It is called the Half-Shower because it bears resemblance to 
	the Shower pattern, where the 
	lower ball is thrown horizontally between hands.
	As always, we are going to break this trick down into its core throws. It 
	can be plainly seen in the animation that one hand is making a constant 
	overthrow, while the other hand is making constant underthrows. This is even 
	more evident if we exaggerate the height of each throw (as seen on the 
	right).<img alt=""  height="167" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/halfshowerexaggerated.gif" width="168" class="smallanim" /><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	For the sake of this tutorial I will be assuming that you are already able 
	to perform Juggler&#39;s Tennis without too much trouble. If you are not 
	familiar with the trick, go learn it; that way you will have a good grasp on 
	doing overthrows. Practicing the Half-Shower is rather simple. Start by 
	doing a single overthrow, and then do a second overthrow from that same 
	hand. After you do that, fall back into the regular Cascade. The idea is to 
	slowly add in more overthrows as you are practicing. Below, the animation is 
	doing a run of four:<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	As you get more and more comfortable with the trick, you can keep adding 
	more and more overthrows until eventually you can run the pattern 
	indefinitely. You will also begin to notice that your pattern can shrink in 
	size, and the overthrows can be made at regular cascade height (as is seen 
	in the main animation at the top of the page). Like the animation directly 
	above, you want to make sure you practice with both hands.</p>
