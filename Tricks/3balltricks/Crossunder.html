	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Crossunder is a variation 
	of Columns in which the simultaneous vertical throws are made with your arms 
	crossed. This adds another layer of complexity and makes for a more 
	interesting—and difficult—pattern. Before attempting the Crossunder you 
	should already be very comfortable juggling Columns with either hand 
	catching the middle ball.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Crossunder, start with one ball in each 
	hand. Cross your arms such that you dominant arm is on top of your 
	non-dominant arm, and then simultaneously make a vertical throw from each 
	hand. Focus on making sure that the balls go straight up and peak at the 
	same height. After the throws you will uncross your hands and catch each 
	ball with the hand that didn&#39;t throw it.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossundertwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this using both arm configurations. To add in the 
	third ball, start with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your 
	non-dominant hand. Make a vertical throw from your dominant hand along the 
	center of your body and then, as that ball peaks and begins to descend, 
	cross your arms and make the two vertical throws practiced in step one. 
	While uncrossing your arms you will catch the center ball with the hand that 
	was crossed <em>under</em> your other hand (you could catch the ball using 
	the hand on top, but that would be a slightly different trick). You will 
	then catch the two vertical balls with your hands uncrossed.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossunderthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. You have just completed one 
	cycle of the Crossunder. To run the pattern continuously all you have to do is 
	make another central vertical throw and then cross your arms in the<em> 
	opposite</em> configuration to make another set of simultaneous throws. Just 
	keep alternating your arm positions with every pair of throws and make sure 
	to catch the center ball with the hand that was on the bottom. The Crossunder is a fun variation of a very easy base pattern (Columns), so the 
	trick is great for beginners who are looking for something a bit more 
	difficult. </p>
