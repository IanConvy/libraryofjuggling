	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeanne is a three ball trick 
	established by William Penman as part of his
	<a href="http://unknownjuggling.tripod.com/hurricaneseries.html">Hurricane 
	Series</a>. It is essentially a hybrid of Orka&#39;s Mess and Rubenstein&#39;s 
	Revenge, with the flourish of the latter pattern being tacked on to the 
	ending flourish of Orka&#39;s Mess. The harmonious combination of the two arm 
	movements gives Jeanne a very smooth and complex flow. Before trying this 
	pattern, it is important that you already be able to juggle Orka&#39;s Mess and 
	Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Jeanne, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Raise your dominant hand up 
	and then cross your non-dominant hand underneath it such that the balls are 
	lined up along a single vertical axis. Simultaneously make a throw from each 
	hand toward the opposite (non-dominant) side of your body, and then follow 
	that up with a throw from your dominant also directed toward the opposite 
	side of your body. This throw will clear space for your dominant hand to 
	catch the top ball from the simultaneous pair (the same ball that it threw) 
	while your non-dominant hand catches the bottom ball. At this point your 
	dominant hand should be crossed over your non-dominant hand, as your 
	non-dominant hand then makes a vertical throw along the dominant side of 
	your body. This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the 
	second ball thrown from your dominant hand. While this is happening, your 
	dominant hand will spin around between the ball thrown and ball being caught 
	with your non-dominant hand, crossing underneath your non-dominant hand. So 
	far, this has all been identical to Orka&#39;s Mess.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as your dominant hand rotates into position, you 
	will begin to swing your non-dominant hand around along roughly the same 
	path, making an under-the-arm throw from your dominant hand toward the 
	center of your body as your dominant hand finishes its rotation (your 
	non-dominant hand should be about halfway through its own swing by this 
	time). This throw will clear space for your dominant hand to catch the 
	vertical ball thrown from your non-dominant hand along the dominant side of 
	your body. Your non-dominant hand will then finish its rotation, ending up 
	still crossed over your dominant hand and positioned near the non-dominant 
	side of your body, catching the last ball thrown from your dominant hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. In this step you are 
	essentially grafting part of Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge on to the end of Orka&#39;s 
	Mess, so while the written instructions above may seem long, the actual 
	throws themselves should feel very natural (until the last throw or two) if 
	you already know Orka&#39;s Mess.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To juggle the full Jeanne pattern, simply make another set of 
	simultaneous throws using both hands before catching the last ball with your 
	non-dominant hand. This will begin a new cycle of the trick, with the hand 
	positions reversed. Jeanne is a very graceful pattern that is both enjoyable 
	to juggle and watch. Assuming you already have the prerequisite patterns 
	mastered, this trick should not be very hard to learn.</p>
