	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Juggler&#39;s Tennis is the second trick most jugglers 
	attempt after having learned the Three Ball Cascade. It gets its name from 
	the one ball that travels back and forth over the others, resembling a 
	tennis match. Overall, Juggler&#39;s Tennis is an easy trick, only marginally 
	harder than the Cascade.<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To 
	start learning any pattern, it is always best to break the trick down into 
	its core features. In this case, the only difference between Juggler&#39;s 
	Tennis and the Cascade is one ball being constantly <em>overthrown</em>, a 
	term used to describe a ball that travels over the others, as opposed to 
	beneath them.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Thus, the best way to learn Juggler&#39;s Tennis is to practice doing 
	overthrows. Starting with a standard Cascade, you are going to want to make 
	one of your throws higher than the rest, allowing that ball to travel above 
	the previous ball instead of underneath it. It is probably best to start 
	learning overthrows with your dominant hand, but eventually you will need to 
	be proficient with both hands. A good way to practice would be to make one 
	overthrow, wait maybe three or four throws, and then make another overthrow, 
	this time with the opposite hand:<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Once you have the occasional overthrow down, you can begin to decrease the 
	number of&nbsp; normal &quot;recovery throws&quot; that you have in between your 
	overthrows. In order to be doing Juggler&#39;s Tennis, the same ball must be 
	constantly overthrownâ€”at no time should any other ball be thrown over it.</p>
