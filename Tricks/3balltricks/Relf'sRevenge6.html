	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relf&#39;s Revenge 6 is a three 
	ball pattern that, ironically, has very little in common with Relf&#39;s 
	Revenge. The trick can best be imagined as Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge with the 
	&quot;U-ball&quot; thrown from the center of your body instead of under-the-arm. This 
	forces a change in the arm flourish and gives the pattern a different 
	overall cadence. Before attempting Relf&#39;s Revenge it is important that you 
	already be fairly comfortable with Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge, but no experience 
	with Relf&#39;s Revenge is necessary.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Relf&#39;s Revenge 6, start with one ball 
	in your dominant hand and two balls in your non-dominant hand. Raise your 
	dominant hand up to about shoulder height, and then shift both of your hands 
	to the center of your body such that your non-dominant hand is positioned 
	under your dominant hand. Make a roughly vertical throw from your 
	non-dominant hand (ideally it should be angled slightly toward your 
	non-dominant side) while simultaneously swinging your dominant hand under 
	and around the thrown ball. As the ball peaks, your dominant hand should be 
	circling over it; you will then throw the ball in your dominant hand over 
	toward the non-dominant side of your body and claw-catch the first ball. So 
	far this should all feel pretty similar to Rubenstein&#39;s Revenge. After the 
	claw-catch you will then swing your dominant hand in a &quot;C&quot; shape toward the 
	dominant side of your body while making a throw from your non-dominant 
	handâ€”the throw will be made from the center of your body toward your 
	dominant side, but it should be mostly vertical. This will clear space for 
	your non-dominant hand to catch the ball thrown by your dominant hand. Your 
	dominant hand will then, after completing its &quot;C&quot;-shaped flourish, catch the 
	ball thrown from your non-dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsrevenge6three.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. You have just 
	completed one cycle of Relf&#39;s Revenge 6. In order to connect both sides of 
	the pattern together, you must change the way you catch the ball thrown by 
	your dominant hand. Instead of simply letting the ball descend into your 
	non-dominant hand, you are going to reach up and claw-catch it. You will 
	then continue the downward motion of the claw-catch while simultaneously 
	making a throw from your dominant hand that mirrors the very first throw you 
	made; this will clear space for your dominant hand to catch the ball your 
	non-dominant hand had thrown (the last throw of the previous step). You will 
	then swing your non-dominant hand around and under the ball just thrown by 
	your dominant hand before finally claw-catching it. You should end up with 
	two balls in your non-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsrevenge6full.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To continue the pattern simply 
	make a throw from your non-dominant hand before doing the claw-catch, and 
	then just keep mirroring the first set of throws and catches you performed.</p>
