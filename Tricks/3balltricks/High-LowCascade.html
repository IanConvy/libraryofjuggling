	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The High-Low Cascade 
	(unofficial name) is a variation of the three ball Cascade in which each 
	regular throw is paired with a simultaneous vertical toss from the other 
	hand. This short toss is quickly caught by the hand that threw it, resulting 
	in no net disruption of the overall Cascade pattern. This trick 
	is fairly simple to learn, with only the regular Cascade as a necessary 
	prerequisite. <br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the High-Low Cascade, start with one ball 
	in each hand. Simultaneously make a high Cascade throw from your dominant 
	hand and a low vertical toss from your non-dominant hand. If timed 
	correctly, the tossed ball should be caught by your non-dominant hand as the 
	other ball reaches its peak. When practicing it is best to 
	exaggerate the height difference to make the timing easier.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. Once you are very 
	comfortable making these two throws in both hand configurations you will be 
	ready to add in the third ball. Start with two balls in your dominant hand 
	and one ball in your non-dominant. Make the same simultaneous throws you 
	performed in the previous step but then, instead of simply waiting to catch 
	the high ball, you will make another pair of simultaneous throws, this time 
	making the high throw with the ball that was previously used for the short 
	throw. This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the high 
	throw made by your dominant hand. The second high throw (made by 
	your non-dominant hand) will then be caught by your dominant hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. You have just completed two 
	cycles of the High-Low Cascade. Simply keep making pairs of of high and low 
	throws to continue the pattern, as if juggling a tall Cascade. </p>
