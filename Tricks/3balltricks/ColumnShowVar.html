	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shower variation of the 
	Columns pattern is a little trick I came up while trying out variations on 
	the standard pattern—though the trick itself has been performed by others 
	before me. Basically you make continuous vertical throws with 
	two balls while passing a third over and underneath, as if juggling the 
	Shower. There really isn&#39;t much material to use for a tutorial—once you 
	have both the Columns and Shower patterns down you should have little 
	difficulty figuring out this trick. Just keep in mind that the Shower 
	portion of the trick will feel rushed, and it may take some time for you to 
	get comfortable with the speed.</p>
