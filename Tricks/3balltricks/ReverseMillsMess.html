	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reverse Mills Mess is a 
	variation of Mills Mess in which the original pattern is time-reversed, 
	meaning that every throw of the Reverse Mills Mess is done where and when a 
	catch would be made in the regular Mills Mess. This means that all of the 
	throws in the Reverse Mills Mess are made from the center, and all catches 
	are made on the outside of your body. <br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Reverse Mills Mess, start with one ball in each 
	hand. With your dominant hand, make a throw from the center of your body out 
	toward your dominant side. Then, bring your non-dominant hand toward the 
	center of your body and make a throw identical to the first. Finally, cross 
	your non-dominant hand underneath your dominant and catch the first ball. 
	Catch the second ball with your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/reversemesstwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. Once you are 
	sufficiently comfortable with the throws, you can chain the cycles to 
	together.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/reversemesstwocycle.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To add in the third ball, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make the first two throws 
	as you did in the previous steps, and then make a third from your dominant 
	hand in the same position and direction as the other two throws. This last 
	throw should be performed when your non-dominant hand is crossed under your 
	dominant hand. As that last ball descends, make a throw with your 
	non-dominant hand from the center of your body toward your non-dominant side 
	(i.e. in the opposite direction of all preceding throws) and then cross your 
	non-dominant hand over your dominant hand to catch the third ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="426" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/reversemessthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To run the full Reverse Mess, 
	simply continue the cycle on the other side (the first throw of the new 
	cycle is the last throw shown in the animation above). The pattern will seem 
	awkward at first, especially if you are already comfortable with the 
	standard Mills Mess. In general, the Reverse Mills Mess is not as fluid and 
	graceful as Mills Mess, and spectators probably won&#39;t be any more impressed 
	by it.</p>
