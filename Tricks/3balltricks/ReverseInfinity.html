	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reverse Infinity is, as it 
	sounds, a time reversed variation of the Infinity. The trick is essentially 
	just Columns with the center ball thrown from the outside such that it will 
	travel between the two vertical balls (when they are thrown again) and be caught in 
	the middle. Given its 
	simplicity I don&#39;t think an in-depth tutorial for this pattern is really necessaryâ€”just 
	juggle Columns and try making the special throw with the center ball. Start 
	with just one or two every so often and then gradually work until you are 
	doing the Reverse Infinity continuously. </p>
