	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Kingston Shuffle is a three 
	ball pattern established by Greg Phillips that uses a rather unique vertical catch along with stacked 
	multiplexes to create a fairly original trick. The Kingston Shuffle also 
	bears some resemblance to the Georgian Shuffle, since it employs a &quot;fake&quot; 
	throw from one hand back to itself.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Kingston Shuffle, start with one ball in your 
	dominant hand and two balls in your non-dominant. Bring your non-dominant 
	hand toward the center of your body, and make a roughly vertical throw 
	angled slightly toward your dominant hand. Simultaneously, raise your 
	dominant hand such that it stays roughly the same distance from the ball 
	thrown by your non-dominant hand. Once that ball reaches its peak and begins 
	to descend, bring your dominant down on it, catching the ball. As that ball 
	is caught, make a throw from your non-dominant hand toward the center of 
	your body, then raise that same hand up and claw catch the ball. As that 
	catch is being made, perform a stacked multiplex throw from your dominant 
	hand, catching the top ball with your dominant hand and the bottom ball with 
	your non-dominant.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/kingstonshufflethree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To add in the final two throws, 
	you are going to reach over and make a Column throw on the opposite side of 
	your body with your non-dominant hand. This will clear space for you to 
	catch the bottom multiplexed ball. Simultaneously, you are going to raise up 
	your dominant hand after you make the multiplex and pluck the top ball out 
	of the air as it&#39;s reaching its peak. You will then swing this ball over and 
	around the Column throw that you just made from your non-dominant hand. That 
	ball will then be thrown from the center of your body toward your 
	non-dominant hand, which will rise up with and drop down to catch the ball 
	(just like in the very first throw).<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/kingstonshufflefull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, practice this on both sides. The final catch of this 
	step marks the beginning of a new cycle, so to run the full Kingston Shuffle 
	you just need to make another throw/claw catch combination using your 
	dominant hand, and then follow it up with a stacked multiplex from your 
	non-dominant hand.</p>
