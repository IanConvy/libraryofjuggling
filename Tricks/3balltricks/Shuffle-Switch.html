	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shuffle-Switch is a 
	variation of Columns where you do a rapid double-pass of the outside balls 
	between hands, before tossing them up. This is one of the more difficult 
	variations, with the high speed &quot;shuffle-switch&quot; dramatically changing the 
	normal timing of&nbsp; the Columns pattern.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the trick, it is best to first concentrate on the 
	double pass by itself. In order to prevent the balls from colliding into 
	each other,&nbsp; you will need to slightly change the height of each throw, 
	with one hand lower than the other.<img alt=""  height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/shuffleswitchtwo.gif" width="400" class="smallanim" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will need to be comfortable enough with this to do it 
	without looking, since your focus will be directed towards maintaining the 
	Columns pattern, with the passes happening on the very edge of your 
	peripheral vision. Once you have this step mastered, you can simply add one 
	or two &quot;shuffles&quot; into a normal Columns run, eventually working your way up 
	to doing a constant Shuffle-Switch. The shuffle move itself is not limited 
	to this particular trick, and can in fact be incorporated into other 
	patterns such as the Shower (thus becoming a variant of the High-Low 
	Shower).</p>
