	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Boston Mess is a Column 
	variation of the standard three ball Mills Mess in which every ball is 
	thrown from the same location while your hands do all the moving. This 
	pattern lacks the more intuitive flow of Mills Mess, and doesn&#39;t look as 
	cool to spectators.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Boston Mess, it is best to start by juggling The 
	W. After catching an inside throw with your dominant hand (the outside ball 
	on your dominant hand side should be in the air), make an outside throw with 
	your non-dominant hand and then cross that hand under your dominant hand, 
	catching the outside ball usually caught by your dominant hand. Then throw 
	the center ball currently in your dominant hand, clearing space to allow 
	that hand to catch the outside ball normally caught by your non-dominant 
	hand (essentially your hands have switched which balls they are throwing 
	without changing the overall shape of the pattern).<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bostonmesstwo.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until it is second nature, since the next step 
	is simply going to add more throws to the sequence. After the last throw of 
	previous step, you should end up with your arms crossed and the center ball 
	in the air. As that ball comes down, you are going to make an outside throw 
	with your non-dominant hand (which should be crossed under your dominant 
	hand) and catch the center ball. Then, as that outside throw is coming down, 
	you are going to make an outside throw with your dominant hand, and then 
	uncross your arms, catching the non-dominant hand&#39;s outside throw. Finally, 
	as that last outside throw is coming down, you are going to make a center 
	throw with your non-dominant hand and catch the outside ball.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bostonmessnext.gif" width="400" />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, practice this step until it is second nature. At this 
	point, the Boston Mess pretty much starts over back at step one, with your 
	dominant hand making an outside throw and catching the center ball, and your 
	non-dominant hand reaching over to grab the outside ball normally caught by 
	your dominant hand. However, as you may have noticed, the full Boston Mess 
	alternates the top hand, such that after you complete one cycle with your 
	dominant hand crossed over your non-dominant hand, the next cycle will have 
	your non-dominant hand crossed over your dominant hand. This doesn&#39;t 
	actually change the order of the throws, it just alters the relative 
	position of your hands. The Boston Mess is a pretty difficult pattern to 
	figure out, so if you are still unable to perform the pattern, try following 
	one of the other tutorials listed at the top right corner of this page.&nbsp; </p>
