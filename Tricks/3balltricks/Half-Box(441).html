	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Half-Box is one of the first tricks jugglers learn 
	that includes a horizontal pass (the ball that goes directly between hands). 
	The pattern is almost universally known by its siteswap, and thus is usually 
	just called the 441. There have been attempts at giving it a name (some have 
	tried to call it Parallel Schizophrenic), but none of them have stuck. I 
	think the name Half-Box matches the trick quite nicely, as it is similar to 
	the normal Box, except slower and easier. This is not unlike the Half-Shower 
	and regular Shower patterns.<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Regardless of the name, learning the Half-Box is fairly simple. Breaking the 
	pattern down, we can see that there are three main components: a Two-in-One 
	in the left hand, then a pass, then a Two-in-One in the right hand. Thus, 
	you should already be proficient at the Two-in-One in both hands, and also 
	be able to do a solid Cascade before attempting this trick.<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	To begin practicing, you are going to start with two ballsâ€”one in your left 
	and one in your right. Then, you are going to make one throw straight up (as 
	if doing a Two-in-One) from your dominant hand, and then right after that 
	you are going to make a horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand to your 
	now empty dominant hand. Then, you are going to make a second Two-in-One 
	throw with that ball you just passed, and then catch the first ball. And 
	finally, you are going to pass that first ball to your non-dominant and 
	catch the second ball. The balls should end up in a different hand than when 
	they started:<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	You are going to want to practice this in each hand, as it is the foundation 
	of the Half-Box. Once you can reliably perform these throws in both 
	directions, you are ready to link them together:<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Now its just a matter of adding the third ball. Start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand, one ball in the other. Throw one ball from your dominant 
	hand, then throw the ball in your non-dominant hand. Right after you throw 
	that second ball, do a horizontal pass from your dominant hand to your 
	non-dominant hand, and then stop. You have just done one run of the 
	Half-Box:<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	All that&#39;s left is just to remove the pause and keep the pattern going. This 
	can be done by throwing another Two-in-One throw at the end of the flash, 
	and just repeating the cycle again:<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	And there you have it. Just keep adding in more and more cycles and 
	eventually you will be able to the Half-Box indefinitely. As the name 
	suggests, this trick is perfect for practicing the Box (though I personally 
	learned the Box first)but it can also be good training for the Shower 
	pattern. </p>
