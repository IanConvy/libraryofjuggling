	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin is a five ball pattern 
	established by Nate Martin. It can be thought of as a variation of the three 
	ball Cascade in which a high vertical toss is made before each crossing 
	throw. This adds some height and complexity to the otherwise simple Cascade, 
	though Martin&#39;s difficulty level still remains well below that of most five 
	ball tricks.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning Martin, start with two balls in your 
	dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Make a fairly high 
	crossing throw from your non-dominant hand to your dominant hand and then, 
	as that ball reaches its peak, make a higher vertical throw from your 
	dominant hand. As the first ball approaches your dominant hand you are going 
	to make another high crossing throw, this time from your dominant hand to 
	your non-dominant hand. This will clear space for your dominant hand to 
	catch the first crossing throw. You will then also catch the high vertical 
	ball with your dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/5balltricks/martinthree.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this on both sides. To add in the fourth and fifth 
	ball, start with two balls in your dominant hand and three balls in your 
	non-dominant hand. Make a high crossing throw from your non-dominant hand to 
	your dominant hand, and then follow that up with the same throws and catches 
	you performed in step one. After you make the crossing throw from your 
	dominant hand back to your non-dominant hand you are then going to repeat 
	the same throws and catches of step one, this time using your non-dominant 
	hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/5balltricks/martinfull.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. To run the full 
	pattern simply keep repeating cycles of step one on alternating sides of 
	your body. Martin has a fairly unique cadence that makes it interesting to 
	juggle, and spectators will likely be fooled into thinking the trick is 
	harder than it really is.&nbsp; </p>
