	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Five Ball Stacked Multiplex 
	Cascade is essentially a three ball Cascade where two of the throws in a 
	given cycle are stacked multiplexes. This means that you are throwing two 
	balls at different heights in the same direction. The addition of two balls 
	to what is normally only a three ball pattern makes the Five Ball Stacked 
	Multiplex Cascade a cramped trick in which collisions are common. For that 
	reason, this trick is more difficult than other five ball multiplex patterns 
	such as the Five Ball Split Multiplex Cascade.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Five Ball Stacked Multiplex Cascade, it is best 
	to begin with the two multiplex throws. Start with two balls in each hand, 
	and then make a stacked multiplex from your dominant hand. As those two 
	balls approach your non-dominant hand, make a second stacked multiplex, this 
	time from your non-dominant hand. This will clear space for you to catch the 
	two balls from the first multiplex. Catch the other two balls in your 
	dominant hand.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/5balltricks/fiveballstackedmultiplexcascadefour.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice these two throws until you can perform them in a 
	controlled manner. At that point, you are ready to add in the fifth ball. 
	Start with three balls in your dominant hand and two balls in your 
	non-dominant. Make a single normal throw from your dominant hand, and then 
	follow it up with&nbsp; multiplex from your non-dominant hand and then a 
	multiplex from your dominant hand. Catch all the balls after these three 
	throws.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/5balltricks/fiveballstackedmultiplexcascadefive.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have mastered all three of these throws, you simply 
	need to make another single Cascade throw and start the cycle all over 
	again. At that point you will be doing the full Five Ball Stacked Multiplex 
	Cascade.</p>
