	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five Ball Multiplex Columns, 
	also called 4 up 1 up, is essentially a three ball Columns pattern with 
	stacked multiplexes made for the outside throws. These simultaneous 
	multiplexes make the trick significantly more difficult to control, 
	particularly when catching them.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Five Ball Multiplex Columns, it is best to begin 
	by practicing the multiplexes. Start with two balls in each hand, and then 
	make a vertical stacked multiplex from each hand. Then catch the balls using 
	the same hand that threw them.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/5balltricks/fiveballmultiplexcolumnsfour.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this step extensively. Once you become comfortable 
	throwing and catching the multiplexes, you are ready to add in the fifth 
	ball. Start with three balls in your dominant hand and two balls in your 
	non-dominant. Make a single vertical throw from your dominant hand at the 
	center of your body, and when that ball reaches its peak and begins to 
	descend, make the two multiplex throws performed in step one, clearing space 
	for you to catch the first ball with your dominant hand. Then catch the rest 
	of the balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/5balltricks/fiveballmultiplexcolumnsfive.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you are able to do one cycle of Five Ball Multiplex 
	Columns, you simply need to make another single vertical throw from the 
	center of your body, and follow it up with another pair of multiplexes. Your 
	pattern will probably be messy at first, with the multiplexes being thrown 
	out of alignment. This will improve as you spend more time practicing the 
	trick.</p>
