	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Five Ball Split Multiplex 
	Cascade is essentially a three ball Cascade where every normal throw is 
	paired with a vertical throw that returns to the same hand. This is the 
	split multiplex, which adds a layer of complexity without making the pattern 
	that much harder. As such, the Five Ball Split Multiplex Cascade is probably 
	one of the easiest tricks that can be done with five balls.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Five Ball Split Multiplex Cascade, start with 
	two balls in each hand. Make a split multiplex from your dominant hand such 
	that one ball travels across your body while the other ball stays roughly in 
	line with your dominant hand. As the ball thrown across your body approaches 
	your non-dominant hand, and as the vertical ball from the multiplex 
	approaches your dominant hand, make a second, identical, multiplex from your 
	non-dominant hand, clearing space for you to catch that first ball. Then 
	catch the rest of the balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/5balltricks/fiveballsplitmultiplexcascadefour.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, practice this on both sides. While the animations 
	in this tutorial all show the two balls being thrown at different heights, 
	this is a purely stylistic choice, as many jugglers throw both balls at 
	equal heights. Once you can make these two multiplex throws consistently, it 
	is time to add in the fifth ball. Start with three balls in your dominant 
	hand and two balls in your non-dominant. Make a single Cascade throw from 
	your dominant hand, and then make a split multiplex from your non-dominant 
	hand, clearing space for your hand to catch the first ball. As the ball from 
	that multiplex approaches your dominant hand, make a second split multiplex 
	and catch that ball. Then catch the rest of the balls.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/5balltricks/fiveballsplitmultiplexcascadefive.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have this first cycle mastered, you simply need to 
	keep making split multiplexes and you will be running the full Five Ball 
	Split Multiplex Cascade.</p>
