	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Five Ball Shower is, as it 
	sounds, a five ball version of the Shower pattern. This means that it is 
	juggled higher and faster than the Four Ball Shower (and much higher and 
	faster than the regular Shower), and as such you should already be very 
	comfortable with the Four Ball Shower before attempting the five ball 
	version.<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin learning the Five Ball Shower it is helpful to first 
	practice juggling the Four Ball Shower at a greater height than usual. This 
	will train you to make more accurate throws, though the timing will be much 
	slower than the full Five Ball Shower.<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/5balltricks/fiveballshowerfour.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this until your throws feel fairly consistent. To 
	add in the fifth ball, start with three balls in your dominant hand and two 
	balls in your non-dominant hand. Quickly make two very high (the exact 
	height is up to you, but the higher the pattern the slower it will be) 
	crossing throws from your dominant hand and then follow them up with two 
	throw/horizontal pass combinations from your dominant and non-dominant hands 
	respectively. You should make the last horizontal pass from your 
	non-dominant hand just as the first ball thrown from your dominant hand is 
	ready to be caught. As the throws from your dominant hand keep descending 
	you will pass the balls caught by your non-dominant hand back to your 
	dominant hand such that you end up with three balls in your dominant hand 
	and two balls in your non-dominant hand (the same way you started).<img class="smallanim" alt="" height="450" src="../../JugglingGifs/5balltricks/fiveballshowerfive.gif" width="400" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have just performed what is for all intents and purposes 
	a flash of the Five Ball Shower (technically you only made four main catches 
	so it isn&#39;t actually a flash). You should practice this until you can make 
	all of the throws at roughly the same height with no collisions. After that 
	you simply need to keep adding in more throws and passes as your skill level 
	increases. The Five Ball Shower is very difficult trick, and it will take 
	you quite a while to master it. </p>
