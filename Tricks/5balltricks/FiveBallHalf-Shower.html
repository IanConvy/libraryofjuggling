	<p id="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Five Ball Half-Shower is 
	basically a Five Ball Cascade where one hand makes constant overthrows, 
	while the other hand makes low throws. This gives the pattern two distinct 
	arches, with the top arch being roughly twice as high as the lower arch.
	<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the Five Ball Half-Shower, I found it easiest to 
	start by juggling a Five Ball Cascade pattern. Then, make an overthrow with 
	your dominant hand, such that the ball travels over all the other balls, and 
	then catch it with your non-dominant hand and resume juggling the Cascade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice this one overthrow until you are able to do it 
	consistently and cleanly. After that, the only thing other thing to do is to 
	keep adding overthrows in an ever-growing chain. As you make these 
	overthrows, you will want to also concentrate on lowering the height of your 
	normal throws, as seen in the animation at the top of this page. However, 
	that animation is not intended to be an absolute representation of the Five 
	Ball Half-Shower, since the pattern itself can be juggled using a variety of 
	a heights, and even a variety of siteswaps such as 73, 5, and (6x,4x).</p>
