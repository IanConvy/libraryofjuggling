This repository holds the code that renders the Library of Juggling, a website dedicated to cataloging juggling patterns. I created the site back in 2012, and it has become an essential resource for jugglers looking to expand their repertoire. Although the library is no longer updated, I continue to host it at <https://libraryofjuggling.com/>.

To prepare this repository, I rebuilt the Library of Juggling using Jekyll so that changes could be more easily propagated across the site. The `_include/default.html` layout file is used by all pages, and contains the side navigation bar which is rendered from `_data/tricks.yml` using Liquid. The juggling GIFs used throughout the site are not tracked here, but can be downloaded in a zip file from this [GCP bucket](https://storage.googleapis.com/icpublicstuff/projects/libraryofjuggling/juggling_gifs.zip). The `JMLarchive` directory includes the JML files that were used by JugglingLab to create most of the GIFs, and is not directly part of the website.

The history of my work on the Library of Juggling is discussed on [my website](https://ianconvy.github.io/projects/other/libraryofjuggling/libraryofjuggling.html).
