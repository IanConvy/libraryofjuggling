        <strong>What is it?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Library of Juggling is an attempt to list all of the 
        popular (and perhaps not so popular) juggling tricks in one organized place. 
        Despite the growing popularity of juggling, few websites are dedicated to 
        collecting and archiving the various patterns that are being performed. Most 
        jugglers are familiar with iconic tricks such as the 
        <a href="{{ "/Tricks/3balltricks/Cascade.html" | relativize_url }}">Cascade</a> and 
        <a href="{{ "/Tricks/3balltricks/Shower.html" | relativize_url }}">Shower</a>, but 
        what about <a href="{{ "/Tricks/3balltricks/Romeo'sRevenge.html" | relativize_url }}">Romeo&#39;s Revenge</a> or the 
        <a href="{{ "/Tricks/3balltricks/531MillsMess.html" | relativize_url }}">531 Mills Mess</a>? The goal of this website 
        is to guarantee that the tricks currently circulating around the internet 
        and at juggling conventions are found, animated, and catalogued for the 
        world to see. It is a daunting task, but for the sake of jugglers everywhere 
        it must be done.
    </p>
    <p class="hometitle">
        <strong>What can I find here?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        For every trick found in the Library, there will be an 
        animated representation of the pattern created via
        <a href="http://jugglinglab.sourceforge.net/">JugglingLab</a>, in 
        addition to general information about the trick (siteswap, difficulty 
        level, prerequisite tricks, etc.). If I am able to run the pattern, then 
        I will provide a text-based tutorial for the trick with the help of 
        animations. I will also include links to other tutorials for the trick 
        that can be found online, ranging from YouTube videos to private sites 
        like this one. If I am unable to provide my own tutorial, there will 
        still be a short description of the trick in addition to outside 
        tutorials and demonstrations.

        <strong>Where do I start?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, if you have come to the Library looking to find 
        out how to start juggling, than it would be best to begin with the
        <a href="{{ "/Tricks/3balltricks/Cascade.html" | relativize_url }}">Three Ball Cascade</a> pattern. 
        If you are a juggler who is already familiar with the basics, then the 
        various tricks included in the Library can be accessed via the navigation 
        tree on the left, or you can <a href="{{ "/TricksByDifficulty.html" | relativize_url }}">click here to 
        view all of the tricks by difficulty.</a>

            The Library of Juggling is on an indefinite hiatus, which means no new tricks 
            will be added. Existing content will continue to be hosted for the foreseeable
            future.
